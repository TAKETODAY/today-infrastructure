/**
 * Thrown to indicate a problem with the JSON API. Such problems include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Attempts to parse or construct malformed documents
 * <li>Use of null as a name
 * <li>Use of numeric types not available to JSON, such as {@link Double#isNaN() NaNs} or
 * {@link Double#isInfinite() infinities}.
 * <li>Lookups using an out of range index or nonexistent name
 * <li>Type mismatches on lookups
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Although this is a checked exception, it is rarely recoverable. Most callers should
 * simply wrap this exception in an unchecked exception and rethrow: <pre class="code">
