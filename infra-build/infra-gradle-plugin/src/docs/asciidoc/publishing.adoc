== Publishing with the Maven-publish Plugin

To publish your Infra jar or war, add it to the publication using the `artifact` method on `MavenPublication`.
Pass the task that produces that artifact that you wish to publish to the `artifact` method.
For example, to publish the artifact produced by the default `infraJar` task:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
include::../gradle/publishing/maven-publish.gradle[tags=publishing]

[[publishing-your-application.distribution]]
== Distributing with the Application Plugin

When the {application-plugin}[`application` plugin] is applied a distribution named `infra` is created.
This distribution contains the archive produced by the `infraJar` or `infraWar` task and scripts to launch it on Unix-like platforms and Windows.
Zip and tar distributions can be built by the `infraDistZip` and `infraDistTar` tasks respectively.
To use the `application` plugin, its `mainClassName` property must be configured with the name of your application's main class.
