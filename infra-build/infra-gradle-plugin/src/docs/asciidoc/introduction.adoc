The Infra Gradle Plugin provides Infra support in https://gradle.org[Gradle].
It allows you to package executable jar or war archives, run Infra applications, and use the dependency management provided by `infra-dependencies`.
Infra's Gradle plugin requires Gradle 7.x (7.5 or later) or 8.x and can be used with Gradle's {gradle-userguide}/configuration_cache.html[configuration cache].

In addition to this user guide, {api-documentation}[API documentation] is also available.
