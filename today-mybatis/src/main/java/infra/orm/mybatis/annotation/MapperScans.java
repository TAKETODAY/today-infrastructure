 * The Container annotation that aggregates several {@link MapperScan} annotations.

 * Can be used natively, declaring several nested {@link MapperScan} annotations.
 * Can also be used in conjunction with Java 8's support for repeatable annotations,
 * where {@link MapperScan} can simply be declared several times on the
 * same method, implicitly generating this container annotation.
