/**
 * XStream {@link Converter} that supports all classes, but throws exceptions for
 * (un)marshalling.
 *
 * <p>The main purpose of this class is to
 * {@linkplain com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream#registerConverter(Converter, int) register}
 * this converter as a catch-all last converter with a
 * {@linkplain com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream#PRIORITY_NORMAL normal}
 * or higher priority, in addition to converters that explicitly handle the domain
 * classes that should be supported. As a result, default XStream converters with
 * lower priorities and possible security vulnerabilities do not get invoked.
 *
 * <p>For instance:
 * <pre class="code">
 * XStreamMarshaller unmarshaller = new XStreamMarshaller();
 * unmarshaller.getXStream().registerConverter(new MyDomainClassConverter(), XStream.PRIORITY_VERY_HIGH);
 * unmarshaller.getXStream().registerConverter(new CatchAllConverter(), XStream.PRIORITY_NORMAL);
 * MyDomainClass myObject = unmarshaller.unmarshal(source);
 * </pre>
