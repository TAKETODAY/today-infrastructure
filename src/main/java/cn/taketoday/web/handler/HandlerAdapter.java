/**
 * MVC framework SPI, allowing parameterization of the core MVC workflow.
 *
 * <p>
 * Interface that must be implemented for each handler type to handle a request.
 * This interface is used to allow the
 * {@link cn.taketoday.web.handler.DispatcherHandler DispatcherHandler} to be
 * indefinitely extensible. The {@code DispatcherHandler} accesses all installed
 * handlers through this interface, meaning that it does not contain code
 * specific to any handler type.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that a handler can be of type {@code Object}. This is to enable handlers
 * from other frameworks to be integrated with this framework without custom
 * coding, as well as to allow for annotation-driven handler objects that do not
 * obey any specific Java interface.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended for application developers. It is available to
 * handlers who want to develop their own web workflow.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: {@code HandlerAdapter} implementors may implement the
 * {@link cn.taketoday.core.Ordered Ordered} interface to be able to specify
 * a sorting order (and thus a priority) for getting applied by the
 * {@code DispatcherHandler}. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest
 * priority.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This framework allows use
 * {@link cn.taketoday.web.handler.HandlerAdapterCapable HandlerAdapterCapable}
 * to specific a HandlerAdapter at startup time
