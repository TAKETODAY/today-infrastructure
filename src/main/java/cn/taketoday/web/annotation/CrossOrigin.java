/**
 * Annotation for permitting cross-origin requests on specific handler classes
 * and/or handler methods. Processed if an appropriate {@code HandlerMapping} is
 * configured.
 *
 * <p>
 * Both Spring Web MVC and Spring WebFlux support this annotation through the
 * {@code RequestMappingHandlerMapping} in their respective modules. The values
 * from each type and method level pair of annotations are added to a
 * {@link CorsConfiguration} and then default values are applied via
 * {@link CorsConfiguration#applyPermitDefaultValues()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The rules for combining global and local configuration are generally additive
 * -- e.g. all global and all local origins. For those attributes where only a
 * single value can be accepted such as {@code allowCredentials} and
 * {@code maxAge}, the local overrides the global value. See
 * {@link CorsConfiguration#combine(CorsConfiguration)} for more details.
