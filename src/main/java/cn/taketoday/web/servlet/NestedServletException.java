/**
 * Subclass of {@link ServletException} that properly handles a root cause in terms
 * of message and stacktrace, just like NestedChecked/RuntimeException does.
 *
 * <p>Note that the plain ServletException doesn't expose its root cause at all,
 * neither in the exception message nor in printed stack traces! While this might
 * be fixed in later Servlet API variants (which even differ per vendor for the
 * same API version), it is not reliably available on Servlet 2.4
 *
 * <p>The similarity between this class and the NestedChecked/RuntimeException
 * class is unavoidable, as this class needs to derive from ServletException.
