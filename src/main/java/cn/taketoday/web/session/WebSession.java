/**
 * Provides a way to identify a user across more than one-page request
 * or visit to a Website and to store information about that user.
 *
 * <p>
 * The container uses this interface to create a session between an
 * HTTP client and an HTTP server. The session persists for a specified
 * time period, across more than one connection or page request from the user.
 * A session usually corresponds to one user, who may visit a site many times.
 * The server can maintain a session in many ways such as using cookies or rewriting URLs.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface allows to
 * <ul>
 * <li>View and manipulate information about a session, such as the
 * session identifier, creation time, and last accessed
 * time
 * <li>Bind objects to sessions, allowing user information to persist
 * across multiple user connections
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Session information is scoped only to the current web application
 * so information stored in one context will not be directly visible in another.
