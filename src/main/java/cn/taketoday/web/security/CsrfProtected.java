/**
 * <p>A controller annotation to validate a CSRF token value received
 * in a request whenever the property {@link Csrf#CSRF_PROTECTION} is
 * set to {@link CsrfOptions#EXPLICIT}. If the property {@link Csrf#CSRF_PROTECTION}
 * is set to {@link CsrfOptions#IMPLICIT}, then the use of this annotation
 * is redundant. TODAY MVC implementations are only REQUIRED to
 * enforce CSRF for POST controllers that consume payloads of type
 * {@link MediaType#APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED}, but other HTTP methods
 * and payloads may be optionally supported by the underlying
 * implementation. If declared at the type level, it applies to all
 * methods in the type.</p>
