/**
 * Enables Framework's annotation-driven cache management capability, similar to the
 * support found in Framework's {@code <cache:*>} XML namespace. To be used together
 * with @{@link cn.taketoday.context.annotation.Configuration Configuration}
 * classes as follows:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &#064;Configuration
 * &#064;EnableCaching
 * public class AppConfig {
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public MyService myService() {
 *         // configure and return a class having &#064;Cacheable methods
 *         return new MyService();
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public CacheManager cacheManager() {
 *         // configure and return an implementation of Framework's CacheManager SPI
 *         SimpleCacheManager cacheManager = new SimpleCacheManager();
 *         cacheManager.setCaches(Arrays.asList(new ConcurrentMapCache("default")));
 *         return cacheManager;
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>For reference, the example above can be compared to the following Spring XML
 * configuration:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &lt;beans&gt;
 *
 *     &lt;cache:annotation-driven/&gt;
 *
 *     &lt;bean id="myService" class="com.foo.MyService"/&gt;
 *
 *     &lt;bean id="cacheManager" class="cn.taketoday.cache.support.SimpleCacheManager"&gt;
 *         &lt;property name="caches"&gt;
 *             &lt;set&gt;
 *                 &lt;bean class="cn.taketoday.cache.concurrent.ConcurrentMapCacheFactoryBean"&gt;
 *                     &lt;property name="name" value="default"/&gt;
 *                 &lt;/bean&gt;
 *             &lt;/set&gt;
 *         &lt;/property&gt;
 *     &lt;/bean&gt;
 *
 * &lt;/beans&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * In both of the scenarios above, {@code @EnableCaching} and {@code
 * <cache:annotation-driven/>} are responsible for registering the necessary Spring
 * components that power annotation-driven cache management, such as the
 * {@link CacheInterceptor CacheInterceptor} and the
 * proxy- or AspectJ-based advice that weaves the interceptor into the call stack when
 * {@link Cacheable @Cacheable} methods are invoked.
 *
 * <p>If the JSR-107 API and Framework's JCache implementation are present, the necessary
 * components to manage standard cache annotations are also registered. This creates the
 * proxy- or AspectJ-based advice that weaves the interceptor into the call stack when
 * methods annotated with {@code CacheResult}, {@code CachePut}, {@code CacheRemove} or
 * {@code CacheRemoveAll} are invoked.
 *
 * <p><strong>A bean of type {@link CacheManager CacheManager}
 * must be registered</strong>, as there is no reasonable default that the framework can
 * use as a convention. And whereas the {@code <cache:annotation-driven>} element assumes
 * a bean <em>named</em> "cacheManager", {@code @EnableCaching} searches for a cache
 * manager bean <em>by type</em>. Therefore, naming of the cache manager bean method is
 * not significant.
 *
 * <p>For those that wish to establish a more direct relationship between
 * {@code @EnableCaching} and the exact cache manager bean to be used,
 * the {@link CachingConfigurer} callback interface may be implemented.
 * Notice the {@code @Override}-annotated methods below:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &#064;Configuration
 * &#064;EnableCaching
 * public class AppConfig implements CachingConfigurer {
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public MyService myService() {
 *         // configure and return a class having &#064;Cacheable methods
 *         return new MyService();
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public CacheManager cacheManager() {
 *         // configure and return an implementation of Framework's CacheManager SPI
 *         SimpleCacheManager cacheManager = new SimpleCacheManager();
 *         cacheManager.setCaches(Arrays.asList(new ConcurrentMapCache("default")));
 *         return cacheManager;
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public KeyGenerator keyGenerator() {
 *         // configure and return an implementation of Framework's KeyGenerator SPI
 *         return new MyKeyGenerator();
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * This approach may be desirable simply because it is more explicit, or it may be
 * necessary in order to distinguish between two {@code CacheManager} beans present in the
 * same container.
 *
 * <p>Notice also the {@code keyGenerator} method in the example above. This allows for
 * customizing the strategy for cache key generation, per Framework's {@link
 * KeyGenerator KeyGenerator} SPI. Normally,
 * {@code @EnableCaching} will configure Framework's
 * {@link SimpleKeyGenerator SimpleKeyGenerator}
 * for this purpose, but when implementing {@code CachingConfigurer}, a key generator
 * must be provided explicitly. Return {@code null} or {@code new SimpleKeyGenerator()}
 * from this method if no customization is necessary.
 *
 * <p>{@link CachingConfigurer} offers additional customization options:
 * that provides a default implementation for all methods which
 * can be useful if you do not need to customize everything. See {@link CachingConfigurer}
 * Javadoc for further details.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #mode} attribute controls how advice is applied: If the mode is
 * {@link AdviceMode#PROXY} (the default), then the other attributes control the behavior
 * of the proxying. Please note that proxy mode allows for interception of calls through
 * the proxy only; local calls within the same class cannot get intercepted that way.
 *
 * <p>Note that if the {@linkplain #mode} is set to {@link AdviceMode#ASPECTJ}, then the
 * value of the {@link #proxyTargetClass} attribute will be ignored. Note also that in
 * this case the {@code spring-aspects} module JAR must be present on the classpath, with
 * compile-time weaving or load-time weaving applying the aspect to the affected classes.
 * There is no proxy involved in such a scenario; local calls will be intercepted as well.
