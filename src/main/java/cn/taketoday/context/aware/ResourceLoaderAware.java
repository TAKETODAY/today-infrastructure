/**
 * Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified of the
 * {@link ResourceLoader} (typically the ApplicationContext) that it runs in.
 * This is an alternative to a full {@link ApplicationContext} dependency via
 * the {@link cn.taketoday.context.aware.ApplicationContextAware} interface.
 *
 * <p>Note that {@link cn.taketoday.core.io.Resource} dependencies can also
 * be exposed as bean properties of type {@code Resource} or {@code Resource[]},
 * populated via Strings with automatic type conversion by the bean factory. This
 * removes the need for implementing any callback interface just for the purpose
 * of accessing specific file resources.
 *
 * <p>You typically need a {@link ResourceLoader} when your application object has to
 * access a variety of file resources whose names are calculated. A good strategy is
 * to make the object use a {@link cn.taketoday.core.io.DefaultResourceLoader}
 * but still implement {@code ResourceLoaderAware} to allow for overriding when
 * running in an {@code ApplicationContext}.
 *
 * <p>A passed-in {@code ResourceLoader} can also be checked for the
 * {@link PatternResourceLoader} interface
 * and cast accordingly, in order to resolve resource patterns into arrays of
 * {@code Resource} objects. This will always work when running in an ApplicationContext
 * (since the context interface extends the ResourcePatternResolver interface). Use a
 * {@link PathMatchingPatternResourceLoader} as
 * default; see also the {@code ResourcePatternUtils.getResourcePatternResolver} method.
 *
 * <p>As an alternative to a {@code ResourcePatternResolver} dependency, consider
 * exposing bean properties of type {@code Resource[]} array, populated via pattern
 * Strings with automatic type conversion by the bean factory at binding time.
