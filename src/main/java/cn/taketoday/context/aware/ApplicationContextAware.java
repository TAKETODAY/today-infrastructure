/**
 * Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified
 * of the {@link ApplicationContext} that it runs in.
 *
 * <p>Implementing this interface makes sense for example when an object
 * requires access to a set of collaborating beans. Note that configuration
 * via bean references is preferable to implementing this interface just
 * for bean lookup purposes.
 *
 * <p>This interface can also be implemented if an object needs access to file
 * resources, i.e. wants to call {@code getResource}, wants to publish
 * an application event, or requires access to the MessageSource. However,
 * it is preferable to implement the more specific {@link ResourceLoaderAware},
 * {@link ApplicationEventPublisherAware} or {@link MessageSourceAware} interface
 * in such a specific scenario.
 *
 * <p>Note that file resource dependencies can also be exposed as bean properties
 * of type {@link cn.taketoday.core.io.Resource}, populated via Strings
 * with automatic type conversion by the bean factory. This removes the need
 * for implementing any callback interface just for the purpose of accessing
 * a specific file resource.
 *
 * <p>{@link cn.taketoday.context.aware.ApplicationContextSupport} is a
 * convenience base class for application objects, implementing this interface.
 *
 * <p>For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the
 * {@link cn.taketoday.beans.factory.BeanFactory BeanFactory javadocs}.
