/**
 * An extension of {@code AnnotationBeanNamePopulator} that uses the fully qualified
 * class name as the default bean name if an explicit bean name is not supplied via
 * a supported type-level annotation such as {@code @Component} (see
 * {@link AnnotationBeanNameGenerator} for details on supported annotations).
 *
 * <p>Favor this bean naming strategy over {@code AnnotationBeanNamePopulator} if
 * you run into naming conflicts due to multiple autodetected components having the
 * same non-qualified class name (i.e., classes with identical names but residing in
 * different packages).
 *
 * <p>Note that an instance of this class is used by default for configuration-level
 * import purposes; whereas, the default for component scanning purposes is a plain
 * {@code AnnotationBeanNamePopulator}.
