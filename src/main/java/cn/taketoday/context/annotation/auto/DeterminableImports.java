 * early. The {@link ImportSelector} and {@link ImportBeanDefinitionRegistrar} interfaces
 * are quite flexible which can make it hard to tell exactly what bean definitions they

 * the same imports, given the same source.
 * <p>
 * Using {@link DeterminableImports} is particularly useful when working with Framework's
 * testing support. It allows for better generation of {@link ApplicationContext} cache
 * keys.
