/**
 * Auto-configuration specific variant of Framework's {@link Order @Order}

 * affecting the order of configuration classes passed to
 * {@link cn.taketoday.context.support.StandardApplicationContext#register(Class...)}.
 * <p>
 * As with standard {@link Configuration @Configuration} classes, the order in which
 * auto-configuration classes are applied only affects the order in which their beans are
 * defined. The order in which those beans are subsequently created is unaffected and is
 * determined by each bean's dependencies and any {@link DependsOn @DependsOn}
 * relationships.
