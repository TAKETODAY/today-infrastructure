/**
 * Annotation that can be used to indicate which constructor to use when binding
 * configuration properties using constructor arguments rather than by calling setters. A
 * single parameterized constructor implicitly indicates that constructor binding should
 * be used unless the constructor is annotated with `@Autowired`.
 * <p>
 * Note: To use constructor binding the class must be enabled using
 * {@link EnableConfigurationProperties @EnableConfigurationProperties} or configuration
 * property scanning. Constructor binding cannot be used with beans that are created by
 * the regular Spring mechanisms (e.g.
 * {@link cn.taketoday.lang.Component @Component} beans, beans created via
 * {@link cn.taketoday.context.annotation.Bean @Bean} methods or beans loaded using
 * {@link cn.taketoday.context.annotation.Import @Import}).
