 * annotation will only be used if the property is not found in the property sources used
 * by the {@link Binder}. For example, if the property is present in the
 * {@link cn.taketoday.core.env.Environment} when binding to
 * {@link cn.taketoday.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties @ConfigurationProperties},
 * the default value for the property will not be used even if the property value is
 * empty.
