 * Beware: calls to this interface are usually made from a
 * {@link WebServerFactoryCustomizerBeanPostProcessor} which is a
 * {@link BeanPostProcessor} (so called very early in the ApplicationContext lifecycle).
 * It might be safer to lookup dependencies lazily in the enclosing BeanFactory rather
 * than injecting them with {@code @Autowired}.
