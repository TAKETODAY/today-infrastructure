 * Simple implementation of the {@link TypeConverter} interface that does not operate on

 * instance for arbitrary type conversion needs, while using the very same conversion
 * algorithm (including delegation to {@link java.beans.PropertyEditor} and
 * {@link cn.taketoday.core.conversion.ConversionService}) underneath.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> Due to its reliance on {@link java.beans.PropertyEditor PropertyEditors},
 * SimpleTypeConverter is <em>not</em> thread-safe. Use a separate instance for each thread.
