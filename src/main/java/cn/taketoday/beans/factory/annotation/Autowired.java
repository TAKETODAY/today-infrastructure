/**
 * Marks a constructor, parameter, field, setter method, or config method as to be
 * autowired by dependency injection facilities. This is an alternative to the JSR-330
 * {@link jakarta.inject.Inject} annotation, adding required-vs-optional semantics.
 *
 * <h3>Autowired Constructors</h3>
 * <p>Only one constructor of any given bean class may declare this annotation with the
 * {@link #required} attribute set to {@code true}, indicating <i>the</i> constructor
 * to autowire when used as a bean. Furthermore, if the {@code required} attribute is
 * set to {@code true}, only a single constructor may be annotated
 * with {@code @Autowired}. If multiple <i>non-required</i> constructors declare the
 * annotation, they will be considered as candidates for autowiring. The constructor
 * with the greatest number of dependencies that can be satisfied by matching beans
 * in the factory will be chosen. If none of the candidates can be satisfied,
 * then a primary/default constructor (if present) will be used. Similarly, if a
 * class declares multiple constructors but none of them is annotated with
 * {@code @Autowired}, then a primary/default constructor (if present) will be used.
 * If a class only declares a single constructor to begin with, it will always be used,
 * even if not annotated. An annotated constructor does not have to be public.
 *
 * <h3>Autowired Fields</h3>
 * <p>Fields are injected right after construction of a bean, before any config methods
 * are invoked. Such a config field does not have to be public.
 *
 * <h3>Autowired Methods</h3>
 * <p>Config methods may have an arbitrary name and any number of arguments; each of
 * those arguments will be autowired with a matching bean in the factory.
 * Bean property setter methods are effectively just a special case of such a general
 * config method. Such config methods do not have to be public.
 *
 * <h3>Autowired Parameters</h3>
 * <p>Although {@code @Autowired} can technically be declared on individual method
 * or constructor parameters
 *
 * <h3>Multiple Arguments and 'required' Semantics</h3>
 * <p>In the case of a multi-arg constructor or method, the {@link #required} attribute
 * is applicable to all arguments. Individual parameters may be declared as Java-8 style
 * {@link java.util.Optional} or, also as {@code @Nullable} overriding the base 'required' semantics.
 *
 * <h3>Autowiring Arrays, Collections, and Maps</h3>
 * <p>In case of an array, {@link java.util.Collection}, or {@link java.util.Map}
 * dependency type, the container autowiring all beans matching the declared value
 * type. For such purposes, the map keys must be declared as type {@code String}
 * which will be resolved to the corresponding bean names. Such a container-provided
 * collection will be ordered, taking into account
 * {@link cn.taketoday.core.Ordered Ordered} and {@link cn.taketoday.core.Order @Order}
 * values of the target components, otherwise following their registration order
 * in the container. Alternatively, a single matching target bean may also be a
 * generally typed {@code Collection} or {@code Map} itself, getting injected as such.
