/**
 * Factory hook that allows for custom modification of an application context's
 * bean definitions, adapting the bean property values of the context's
 * underlying bean factory.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor} may interact with and modify bean
 * definitions, but never bean instances. Doing so may cause premature bean
 * instantiation, violating the container and causing unintended side-effects.
 * If bean instance interaction is required, consider implementing
 * {@link BeanPostProcessor} instead.
 *
 * <h3>Registration</h3>
 * <p>
 * An {@code ApplicationContext} auto-detects {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor}
 * beans in its bean definitions and applies them before any other beans get
 * created. A {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor} may also be registered
 * programmatically with a {@code ConfigurableApplicationContext}.
 *
 * <h3>Ordering</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor} beans that are autodetected in an
 * {@code ApplicationContext} will be ordered according to
 * {@link Ordered} semantics. In contrast,
 * {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor} beans that are registered programmatically
 * with a
 * {@link cn.taketoday.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext#addBeanFactoryPostProcessor(BeanFactoryPostProcessor)
 * addBeanFactoryPostProcessor} will be applied in the order of registration;
 * any ordering semantics expressed through implementing the {@code Ordered}
 * interface will be ignored for programmatically registered post-processors.
 * Furthermore, the {@link Order @Order}
 * annotation is not taken into account for {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor}
 * beans.
