/**
 * A {@link FactoryBean} implementation that returns a value which is an
 * {@link Supplier} that in turn returns a bean sourced from a {@link BeanFactory}.
 *
 * <p>As such, this may be used to avoid having a client object directly calling
 * {@link BeanFactory#getBean(String)} to get
 * a (typically prototype) bean from a {@link BeanFactory}, which would be a
 * violation of the inversion of control principle. Instead, with the use
 * of this class, the client object can be fed an {@link Supplier} instance as a
 * property which directly returns only the one target bean (again, which is
 * typically a prototype bean).
 *
 * <p>A sample config in an XML-based {@link BeanFactory} might look as follows:
 *
 * <pre class="code">&lt;beans&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;!-- Prototype bean since we have state --&gt;
 *   &lt;bean id="myService" class="a.b.c.MyService" scope="prototype"/&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;bean id="myServiceFactory"
 *       class="cn.taketoday.beans.factory.config.SupplierFactoryCreatingFactoryBean"&gt;
 *     &lt;property name="targetBeanName"&gt;&lt;idref local="myService"/&gt;&lt;/property&gt;
 *   &lt;/bean&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;bean id="clientBean" class="a.b.c.MyClientBean"&gt;
 *     &lt;property name="myServiceFactory" ref="myServiceFactory"/&gt;
 *   &lt;/bean&gt;
 *
 * &lt;/beans&gt;</pre>
 *
 * <p>The attendant {@code MyClientBean} class implementation might look
 * something like this:
 *
 * <pre class="code">package a.b.c;
 *
 * import java.util.function.Supplier;
 *
 * public class MyClientBean {
 *
 *   private ObjectFactory&lt;MyService&gt; myServiceFactory;
 *
 *   public void setMyServiceFactory(ObjectFactory&lt;MyService&gt; myServiceFactory) {
 *     this.myServiceFactory = myServiceFactory;
 *   }
 *
 *   public void someBusinessMethod() {
 *     // get a 'fresh', brand new MyService instance
 *     MyService service = this.myServiceFactory.getObject();
 *     // use the service object to effect the business logic...
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>An alternate approach to this application of an object creation pattern
 * would be to use the {@link ServiceLocatorFactoryBean}
 * to source (prototype) beans. The {@link ServiceLocatorFactoryBean} approach
 * has the advantage of the fact that one doesn't have to depend on any
 * interface such as {@link java.util.function.Supplier},
 * but has the disadvantage of requiring runtime class generation. Please do
 * consult the {@link ServiceLocatorFactoryBean ServiceLocatorFactoryBean JavaDoc}
 * for a fuller discussion of this issue.
