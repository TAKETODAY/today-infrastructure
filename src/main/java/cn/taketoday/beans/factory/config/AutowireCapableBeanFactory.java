/**
 * Extension of the {@link cn.taketoday.beans.factory.BeanFactory}
 * interface to be implemented by bean factories that are capable of
 * autowiring, provided that they want to expose this functionality for
 * existing bean instances.
 *
 * <p>This subinterface of BeanFactory is not meant to be used in normal
 * application code: stick to {@link cn.taketoday.beans.factory.BeanFactory}
 * for typical use cases.
 *
 * <p>Integration code for other frameworks can leverage this interface to
 * wire and populate existing bean instances that Frameworkdoes not control
 * the lifecycle of. This is particularly useful for WebWork Actions and
 * Tapestry Page objects, for example.
 *
 * <p>Note that this interface is not implemented by
 * {@link cn.taketoday.context.ApplicationContext} facades,
 * as it is hardly ever used by application code. That said, it is available
 * from an application context too, accessible through ApplicationContext's
 * {@link cn.taketoday.context.ApplicationContext#getAutowireCapableBeanFactory()}
 * method.
 *
 * <p>You may also implement the {@link cn.taketoday.beans.factory.BeanFactoryAware}
 * interface, which exposes the internal BeanFactory even when running in an
 * ApplicationContext, to get access to an AutowireCapableBeanFactory:
 * simply cast the passed-in BeanFactory to AutowireCapableBeanFactory.
