/**
 * Callback interface triggered at the end of the singleton pre-instantiation phase
 * during {@link BeanFactory} bootstrap. This interface can be implemented by
 * singleton beans in order to perform some initialization after the regular
 * singleton instantiation algorithm, avoiding side effects with accidental early
 * initialization (e.g. from {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory#getBeansOfType} calls).
 * In that sense, it is an alternative to {@link InitializingBean} which gets
 * triggered right at the end of a bean's local construction phase.
 *
 * <p>This callback variant is somewhat similar to {@link cn.taketoday.context.event.ContextStartedEvent}
 * but doesn't require an implementation of {@link ApplicationListener},
 * with no need to filter context references across a context hierarchy etc.
