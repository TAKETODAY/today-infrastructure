/**
 * Factory for a {@code Map} that reads from a YAML source, preserving the
 * YAML-declared value types and their structure.
 *
 * <p>YAML is a nice human-readable format for configuration, and it has some
 * useful hierarchical properties. It's more or less a superset of JSON, so it
 * has a lot of similar features.
 *
 * <p>If multiple resources are provided the later ones will override entries in
 * the earlier ones hierarchically; that is, all entries with the same nested key
 * of type {@code Map} at any depth are merged. For example:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * foo:
 *   bar:
 *    one: two
 * three: four
 * </pre>
 *
 * plus (later in the list)
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * foo:
 *   bar:
 *    one: 2
 * five: six
 * </pre>
 *
 * results in an effective input of
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * foo:
 *   bar:
 *    one: 2
 * three: four
 * five: six
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that the value of "foo" in the first document is not simply replaced
 * with the value in the second, but its nested values are merged.
 *
 * <p>Requires SnakeYAML 1.18 or higher
