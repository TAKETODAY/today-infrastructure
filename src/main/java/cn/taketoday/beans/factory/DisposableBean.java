/**
 * Interface to be implemented by beans that want to release resources on destruction.
 * A {@link BeanFactory} will invoke the destroy method on individual destruction of a
 * scoped bean. An {@link cn.taketoday.context.ApplicationContext} is supposed
 * to dispose all of its singletons on shutdown, driven by the application lifecycle.
 *
 * <p>A Framework-managed bean may also implement Java's {@link AutoCloseable} interface
 * for the same purpose. An alternative to implementing an interface is specifying a
 * custom destroy method, for example in an XML bean definition. For a list of all
 * bean lifecycle methods, see the {@link BeanFactory BeanFactory javadocs}.
