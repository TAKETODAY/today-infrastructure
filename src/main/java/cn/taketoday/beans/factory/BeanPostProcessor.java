/**
 * Factory hook that allows for custom modification of new bean instances
 * &mdash; for example, checking for marker interfaces or wrapping beans with
 * proxies.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE</b>: this mainly a marker interface for post processing a bean,
 * this is not like  BeanPostProcessor
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typically, post-processors that populate beans via marker interfaces or the
 * like will implement {@link InitializationBeanPostProcessor#postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object, String)},
 * while post-processors that wrap beans with proxies will normally implement
 * {@link InitializationBeanPostProcessor#postProcessAfterInitialization(Object, String)}.
 *
 * <h3>Registration</h3>
 * <p>
 * An {@code ApplicationContext} can autodetect {@code BeanPostProcessor} beans
 * in its bean definitions and apply those post-processors to any beans
 * subsequently created. A plain {@code BeanFactory} allows for programmatic
 * registration of post-processors, applying them to all beans created through
 * the bean factory.
 *
 * <h3>Ordering</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@code BeanPostProcessor} beans that are autodetected in an
 * {@code ApplicationContext} will be ordered according to
 * {@link Ordered Ordered} semantics. In contrast,
 * {@code BeanPostProcessor} beans that are registered programmatically with a
 * {@code BeanFactory} will be applied in the order of registration; any
 * ordering semantics expressed through implementing the {@code PriorityOrdered}
 * or {@code Ordered} interface will be ignored for programmatically registered
 * post-processors. Furthermore, the
 * {@link Order @Order} annotation is not taken
 * into account for {@code BeanPostProcessor} beans.
