Provides the API for the <strong>Unified Expression Language 3.0</strong>

<p>The Expression Language (EL) is a simple language originally designed to
  satisfy the specific needs of web application developers. It has evloved
  into its own specification intended for general use inside and outside of the
  web containers.</p>

<p>This package contains the classes and interfaces that describe
  and define the programmatic access to the Expression Language engine. The API
  is logically partitioned as follows:

<ul>
  <li><a href="#Context">EL Context</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ExpressionObjects">Expression Objects</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ExpressionCreation">Creation of Expressions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ExpressionEvaluation">Evaluation of Expressions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#EvaluationListener">Evaluation Listeners</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Resolver">Resolution of Model Objects and their Properties</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Functions">EL Functions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Variables">EL Variables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Standalone">EL in Stand-alone environment</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Context">EL Context</a></h3>

<p>An important goal of the EL is to ensure it can be used in
  a variety of environments. It must therefore provide enough flexibility
  to adapt to the specific requirements of the environment where it is
  being used.</p>

<p>Class {@link jakarta.el.ELContext} is what links
  the EL with the specific environment where it is being used.
  It provides
  the mechanism through which all relevant context for creating or
  evaluating an expression is specified.
</p>

<p>When EL used in a web container, the creation of <code>ELContext
</code> objects is controlled through the underlying technology.
  For example, in JSP, the
  <code>JspContext.getELContext()</code> factory method is used. In an
  stand-alone environment, a default {@link jakarta.el.StandardELContext} is
  provided.</p>

<p>Some technologies provide the ability to add an {@link jakarta.el.ELContextListener}
  so that applications and frameworks can ensure their own context objects
  are attached to any newly created <code>ELContext</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="ExpressionObjects">Expression Objects</a></h3>

<p>At the core of the Expression Language is the notion of an <i>expression</i>
  that gets parsed according to the grammar defined by the Expression Language.</p>

<p>There are two types of expressions defined by the EL: <i>value expressions</i>
  and <i>method expressions</i>. A {@link jakarta.el.ValueExpression} such as
  <code>"${customer.name}"</code> can be used either
  as an <i>rvalue</i> (return the value associated with property <code>name</code>
  of the model object <code>customer</code>) or as an <i>lvalue</i>
  (set the value of the property <code>name</code> of the model object
  <code>customer</code>).</p>

<p>A {@link jakarta.el.MethodExpression} such as
  <code>"${handler.process}"</code> makes it possible to invoke a method
  (<code>process</code>) on a specific model object (<code>handler</code>).</p>

<p>In version 2.2 and later, either type of EL expression can represent a method
  invocation, such as <code>${trader.buy("JAVA")}</code>, where the arugments to
  the method invocation are specified in the expression.</p>

<p>All expression classes extend the base class {@link jakarta.el.Expression}, making them
  serializable and forcing them to implement <code>equals()</code> and
  <code>hashCode()</code>. Morevover, each method on these expression classes
  that actually evaluates an expression receives a parameter
  of class {@link jakarta.el.ELContext},
  which provides the context required to evaluate the expression.</p>

<h3><a name="ExpressionCreation">Creation of Expressions</a></h3>

<p>An expression is created through the {@link jakarta.el.ExpressionFactory} class.
  The factory provides two creation methods; one for each type of expression
  supported by the EL.</p>

<p>To create an expression, one must provide an {@link jakarta.el.ELContext},
  a string representing
  the expression, and the expected type (<code>ValueExpression</code>) or signature
  (<code>MethodExpression</code>).

  The <code>ELContext</code> provides the context necessary to parse an expression.
  Specifically, if the expression uses an EL function
  (for example <code>${fn:toUpperCase(customer.name)}</code>) or an
  EL variable, then
  {@link jakarta.el.FunctionMapper} and {@link jakarta.el.VariableMapper}
  objects must be available within the <code>ELContext</code> so that EL functions and
  EL variables are properly mapped.

<h3><a name="ExpressionEvaluation">Evaluation of Expressions</a></h3>
<p>The creation and the evaluation of an expression are done in two separate
  steps. At the evaluation of an expression,
  the {@link jakarta.el.ELContext}
  provides the context necessary to support property and method resolution
  for modal objects.</p>

<p>A deferred expression is one that is created but not immediately evaluated.
  In a JSF request processing life cycle, EL expressions are typically created
  in the tree building phase and evaluated in the rendering phrase.</p>

<p>Adding parameters to a <code>ValueExpression</code> further enhances the
  power of deferred expressions. The {@link jakarta.el.LambdaExpression}
  encapsulates such a construct. A <code>LambdaExpression</code> can be
  invoked by supplying the actual parameters at evaluation. It plays
  an important role in the support for collections operators.</p>

<h3><a name="EvaluationListener">Evaluation Listeners</a></h3>
<p>By registering {@link jakarta.el.EvaluationListener}s in ELContext, a user can
  receive notifications during the EL expression evaluations. There are three
  events that trigger the notification:
<ul>
  <li>Before evaluation</li>
  <li>After evaluation</li>
  <li>When (base, property) is resolved</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="Resolver">Resolution of Model Objects and their Properties</a></h3>

<p>Through the {@link jakarta.el.ELResolver} base class, the EL
  features a pluggable mechanism
  to resolve model object references as well as properties and method
  invocations of these objects.</p>

<p>The EL API provides implementations of <code>ELResolver</code> supporting
  property resolution for common data types which include
  arrays ({@link jakarta.el.ArrayELResolver}), JavaBeans ({@link jakarta.el.BeanELResolver}), <code>List</code>s ({@link
  jakarta.el.ListELResolver}),
  <code>Map</code>s ({@link jakarta.el.MapELResolver}), and <code>ResourceBundle</code>s ({@link javax.el.ResourceBundleELResolver}).</p>

<p>Tools can easily obtain more information about resolvable model objects and their
  resolvable properties by calling
  method <code>getFeatureDescriptors</code> on the <code>ELResolver</code>. This method exposes objects
  of type <code>java.beans.FeatureDescriptor</code>, providing all information of interest
  on top-level model objects as well as their properties.</p>

<h3><a name="Functions">EL Functions</a></h3>

<p>If an EL expression uses a function
  (for example <code>${fn:toUpperCase(customer.name)}</code>), then a
  {@link javax.el.FunctionMapper}
  object must also be specified within the <code>ELContext</code>.
  The <code>FunctionMapper</code> is responsible to map
  <code>${prefix:name()}</code> style functions to
  static methods that can execute the specified functions.
</p>

<h3><a name="Variables">EL Variables</a></h3>

<p>Just like {@link javax.el.FunctionMapper} provides
  a flexible mechanism to add functions to the EL, {@link javax.el.VariableMapper}
  provides a flexible mechanism to support the notion of
  <strong>EL variables</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  An EL variable does not directly refer to a model object that can then
  be resolved by an <code>ELResolver</code>. Instead, it refers to an EL
  expression. The evaluation of that EL expression gives the EL variable
  its value.
</p>

<p>
  For example, in the following code snippet
<blockquote>
  <code>&lt;h:inputText value="#{handler.customer.name}"/></code>
</blockquote>

<code>handler</code> refers to a model object that can be resolved by an EL Resolver.
</p>
<p>
  However, in this other example:
<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;c:forEach var="item" items="#{model.list}">
   &lt;h:inputText value="#{item.name}"/>
&lt;/c:forEach>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<code>item</code> is an EL variable because it does not refer directly to a model
object. Instead, it refers to another EL expression, namely a
specific item in the collection referred to by the EL expression
<code>#{model.list}</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Assuming that there are three elements in <code>${model.list}</code>, this means
  that for
  each invocation of <code>&lt;h:inputText></code>, the following information
  about <code>item</code> must be preserved in the {@link javax.el.VariableMapper}:
<blockquote>
  first invocation: <code>item</code> maps to first element in <code>${model.list}</code><br>
  second invocation: <code>item</code> maps to second element in <code>${model.list}</code><br>
  third invocation: <code>item</code> maps to third element in <code>${model.list}</code><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
  <code>VariableMapper</code> provides the mechanisms required to allow the mapping
  of an EL variable to the EL expression from which it gets its value.
</p>

<h3><a name="Standalone">EL in Stand-alone environment</a></h3>
<p>EL 3.0 includes APIs for using EL in a stand-alone environment.</p>
<p>{@link javax.el.ELProcessor} provides simple APIs for the direct
  evaluations of expressions. It also makes it easy to define functions,
  set variables, and define a beans locally.</p>

<p>{@link javax.el.ELManager} provides a lower level APIs for managing the EL
  parsing and evaluation environment. It contains a default ELContext
  {@link javax.el.StandardELContext}.</p>
