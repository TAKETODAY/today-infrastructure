/**
 * Defines property resolution behavior on arrays.
 *
 * <p>
 * This resolver handles base objects that are Java language arrays. It accepts
 * any object as a property and coerces that object into an integer index into
 * the array. The resulting value is the value in the array at that index.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This resolver can be constructed in read-only mode, which means that
 * {@link #isReadOnly} will always return <code>true</code> and
 * {@link #setValue} will always throw
 * <code>PropertyNotWritableException</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>ELResolver</code>s are combined together using
 * {@link ExpressionResolverComposite}s, to define rich semantics for evaluating an
 * expression. See the javadocs for {@link ExpressionResolver} for details.
