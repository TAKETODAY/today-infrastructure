/**
 * A property accessor is able to read from (and possibly write to) an object's properties.
 *
 * <p>This interface places no restrictions, and so implementors are free to access properties
 * directly as fields or through getters or in any other way they see as appropriate.
 *
 * <p>A resolver can optionally specify an array of target classes for which it should be
 * called. However, if it returns {@code null} from {@link #getSpecificTargetClasses()},
 * it will be called for all property references and given a chance to determine if it
 * can read or write them.
 *
 * <p>Property resolvers are considered to be ordered, and each will be called in turn.
 * The only rule that affects the call order is that any resolver naming the target
 * class directly in {@link #getSpecificTargetClasses()} will be called first, before
 * the general resolvers.
