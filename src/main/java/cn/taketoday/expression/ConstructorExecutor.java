// TODO Is the resolver/executor model too pervasive in this package?

/**
 * Executors are built by resolvers and can be cached by the infrastructure to repeat an
 * operation quickly without going back to the resolvers. For example, the particular
 * constructor to run on a class may be discovered by the reflection constructor resolver
 * - it will then build a ConstructorExecutor that executes that constructor and the
 * ConstructorExecutor can be reused without needing to go back to the resolver to
 * discover the constructor again.
 *
 * <p>They can become stale, and in that case should throw an AccessException - this will
 * cause the infrastructure to go back to the resolvers to ask for a new one.
