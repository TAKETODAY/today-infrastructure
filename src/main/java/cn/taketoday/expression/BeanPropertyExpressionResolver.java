/**
 * Defines property resolution behavior on objects using the JavaBeans component
 * architecture.
 *
 * <p>
 * This resolver handles base objects of any type, as long as the base is not
 * <code>null</code>. It accepts any object as a property or method, and coerces
 * it to a string.
 *
 * <p>
 * For property resolution, the property string is used to find a JavaBeans
 * compliant property on the base object. The value is accessed using JavaBeans
 * getters and setters.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For method resolution, the method string is the name of the method in the
 * bean. The parameter types can be optionally specified to identify the method.
 * If the parameter types are not specified, the parameter objects are used in
 * the method resolution.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This resolver can be constructed in read-only mode, which means that
 * {@link #isReadOnly} will always return <code>true</code> and
 * {@link #setValue} will always throw
 * <code>PropertyNotWritableException</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>ELResolver</code>s are combined together using
 * {@link ExpressionResolverComposite}s, to define rich semantics for evaluating
 * an expression. See the javadocs for {@link ExpressionResolver} for details.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Because this resolver handles base objects of any type, it should be placed
 * near the end of a composite resolver. Otherwise, it will claim to have
 * resolved a property before any resolvers that come after it get a chance to
 * test if they can do so as well.
 * </p>
