   * prefers submitted tasks to perform as little work as they can within a single
   * task execution. For example, submitted tasks might break a repeated loop into
   * individual subtasks which submit a follow-up task afterwards (if feasible).
   * <p>This should be considered a hint. Of course {@code TaskExecutor} clients
   * are free to ignore this flag and hence the {@code SchedulingTaskExecutor}
   * interface overall. However, thread pools will usually indicated a preference
   * for short-lived tasks, allowing for more fine-grained scheduling.
