/**
 * Strategy for processing {@code DataBinder}'s missing field errors,
 * and for translating a {@code PropertyAccessException} to a
 * {@code FieldError}.
 *
 * <p>The error processor is pluggable so you can treat errors differently
 * if you want to. A default implementation is provided for typical needs.
 *
 * <p>Note: As of Spring 2.0, this interface operates on a given BindingResult,
 * to be compatible with any binding strategy (bean property, direct field access, etc).
 * It can still receive a BindException as argument (since a BindException implements
 * the BindingResult interface as well) but no longer operates on it directly.
