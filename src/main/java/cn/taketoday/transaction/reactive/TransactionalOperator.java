/**
 * Operator class that simplifies programmatic transaction demarcation and
 * transaction exception handling.
 *
 * <p>The central method is {@link #transactional}, supporting transactional wrapping
 * of functional sequences code that. This operator handles the transaction lifecycle
 * and possible exceptions such that neither the ReactiveTransactionCallback
 * implementation nor the calling code needs to explicitly handle transactions.
 *
 * <p>Typical usage: Allows for writing low-level data access objects that use
 * resources such as database connections but are not transaction-aware themselves.
 * Instead, they can implicitly participate in transactions handled by higher-level
 * application services utilizing this class, making calls to the low-level
 * services via an inner-class callback object.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Transactional Publishers should avoid Subscription
 * cancellation. See the
 * <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#tx-prog-operator-cancel">Cancel Signals</a>
 * section of the Spring Framework reference for more details.
