/**
 * An {@link EventListener} that is invoked according to a {@link TransactionPhase}.
 * This is an annotation-based equivalent of {@link TransactionalApplicationListener}.
 *
 * <p>If the event is not published within an active transaction, the event is discarded
 * unless the {@link #fallbackExecution} flag is explicitly set. If a transaction is
 * running, the event is handled according to its {@code TransactionPhase}.
 *
 * <p>Adding {@link Order @Order} to your annotated
 * method allows you to prioritize that listener amongst other listeners running before
 * or after transaction completion.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE: Transactional event listeners only work with thread-bound transactions
 * managed by a {@link PlatformTransactionManager
 * PlatformTransactionManager}.</b> A reactive transaction managed by a
 * {@link cn.taketoday.transaction.ReactiveTransactionManager ReactiveTransactionManager}
 * uses the Reactor context instead of thread-local variables, so from the perspective of
 * an event listener, there is no compatible active transaction that it can participate in.
 *
 * <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> if the {@code TransactionPhase} is set to
 * {@link TransactionPhase#AFTER_COMMIT AFTER_COMMIT} (the default),
 * {@link TransactionPhase#AFTER_ROLLBACK AFTER_ROLLBACK}, or
 * {@link TransactionPhase#AFTER_COMPLETION AFTER_COMPLETION}, the transaction will
 * have been committed or rolled back already, but the transactional resources might
 * still be active and accessible. As a consequence, any data access code triggered
 * at this point will still "participate" in the original transaction, but changes
 * will not be committed to the transactional resource. See
 * {@link cn.taketoday.transaction.support.TransactionSynchronization#afterCompletion(int)
 * TransactionSynchronization.afterCompletion(int)} for details.
