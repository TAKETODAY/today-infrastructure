/**
 * Exception to be thrown when a transaction has timed out.
 *
 * <p>
 * Thrown by local transaction strategies if the deadline for a
 * transaction has been reached when an operation is attempted, according to the
 * timeout specified for the given transaction.
 *
 * <p>
 * Beyond such checks before each transactional operation, local
 * transaction strategies will also pass appropriate timeout values to resource
 * operations (for example to JDBC Statements, letting the JDBC driver respect
 * the timeout). Such operations will usually throw native resource exceptions
 * (for example, JDBC SQLExceptions) if their operation timeout has been
 * exceeded, to be converted to DataAccessException in the respective
 * DAO (which might use JdbcTemplate, for example).
 *
 * <p>
 * In a JTA environment, it is up to the JTA transaction coordinator to apply
 * transaction timeouts. Usually, the corresponding JTA-aware connection pool
 * will perform timeout checks and throw corresponding native resource
 * exceptions (for example, JDBC SQLExceptions).
