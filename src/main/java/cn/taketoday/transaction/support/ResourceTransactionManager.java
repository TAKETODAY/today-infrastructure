 * Extension of the {@link PlatformTransactionManager}
 * interface, indicating a native resource transaction manager, operating on a single
 * target resource. Such transaction managers differ from JTA transaction managers in
 * that they do not use XA transaction enlistment for an open number of resources but
 * rather focus on leveraging the native power and simplicity of a single target resource.
 *
 * <p>This interface is mainly used for abstract introspection of a transaction manager,
 * giving clients a hint on what kind of transaction manager they have been given
 * and on what concrete resource the transaction manager is operating on.
