/**
 * {@link cn.taketoday.orm.jpa.JpaDialect} implementation for Eclipse
 * Persistence Services (EclipseLink). Developed and tested against EclipseLink 2.7;
 * backwards-compatible with EclipseLink 2.5 and 2.6 at runtime.
 *
 * <p>By default, this class acquires an early EclipseLink transaction with an early
 * JDBC Connection for non-read-only transactions. This allows for mixing JDBC and
 * JPA/EclipseLink operations in the same transaction, with cross visibility of
 * their impact. If this is not needed, set the "lazyDatabaseTransaction" flag to
 * {@code true} or consistently declare all affected transactions as read-only.
 * this will reliably avoid early JDBC Connection retrieval
 * and therefore keep EclipseLink in shared cache mode.
