 * Simple converter from Java 8's {@link ZoneId} to {@link TimeZone}.
 *
 * <p>Note that Spring's default ConversionService setup understands the 'from'/'to' convention
 * that the JSR-310 {@code java.time} package consistently uses. That convention is implemented
 * reflectively in {@link ObjectToObjectConverter}, not in specific JSR-310 converters.
 * It covers {@link TimeZone#toZoneId()} as well, and also
 * {@link java.util.Date#from(java.time.Instant)} and {@link java.util.Date#toInstant()}.
