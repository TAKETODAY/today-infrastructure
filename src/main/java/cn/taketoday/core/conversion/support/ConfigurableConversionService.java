/**
 * Configuration interface to be implemented by most if not all {@link ConversionService}
 * types. Consolidates the read-only operations exposed by {@link ConversionService} and
 * the mutating operations of {@link ConverterRegistry} to allow for convenient ad-hoc
 * addition and removal of {@link cn.taketoday.core.conversion.Converter Converters}
 * through. The latter is particularly useful when working against a
 * {@link cn.taketoday.core.env.ConfigurableEnvironment ConfigurableEnvironment}
 * instance in application context bootstrapping code.
