   * Invokes the underlying method represented by this {@code Invoker}
   * object, on the specified object with the specified parameters.
   * Individual parameters are automatically unwrapped to match
   * primitive formal parameters, and both primitive and reference
   * parameters are subject to method invocation conversions as
   * necessary.
   *
   * <p>If the underlying method is static, then the specified {@code obj}
   * argument is ignored. It may be null.
   *
   * <p>If the number of formal parameters required by the underlying method is
   * 0, the supplied {@code args} array may be of length 0 or null.
   *
   * <p>If the underlying method is static, the class that declared
   * the method is initialized if it has not already been initialized.
   *
   * <p>If the method completes normally, the value it returns is
   * returned to the caller of invoke; if the value has a primitive
   * type, it is first appropriately wrapped in an object. However,
   * if the value has the type of array of a primitive type, the
   * elements of the array are <i>not</i> wrapped in objects; in
   * other words, an array of primitive type is returned.  If the
   * underlying method return type is void, the invocation returns
   * null.
   *
   * @param obj the object the underlying method is invoked from
   * @param args the arguments used for the method call
   * @return the result of dispatching the method represented by
   * this object on {@code obj} with parameters
   * {@code args}
   * @throws NullPointerException if the specified object is null and the method is an instance method.
   * @throws ExceptionInInitializerError if the initialization provoked by this method fails.
