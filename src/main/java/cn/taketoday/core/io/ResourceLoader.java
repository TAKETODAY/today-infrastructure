/**
 * Strategy interface for resolving a location pattern (for example, an
 * Ant-style path pattern) into Resource objects.
 *
 * <p>
 * Can be used with any sort of location pattern (e.g.
 * "/WEB-INF/*-context.xml"): Input patterns have to match the strategy
 * implementation. This interface just specifies the conversion method rather
 * than a specific pattern format.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface also suggests a new resource prefix "classpath*:" for all
 * matching resources from the class path. Note that the resource location is
 * expected to be a path without placeholders in this case (e.g. "/beans.xml");
 * JAR files or classes directories can contain multiple files of the same name.
