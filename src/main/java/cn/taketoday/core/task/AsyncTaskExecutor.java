/**
 * Extended interface for asynchronous {@link TaskExecutor} implementations,
 * offering an overloaded {@link #execute(Runnable, long)} variant with a start
 * timeout parameter as well support for {@link Callable}.
 *
 * <p>Note: The {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors} class includes a set of
 * methods that can convert some other common closure-like objects, for example,
 * {@link java.security.PrivilegedAction} to {@link Callable} before executing them.
 *
 * <p>Implementing this interface also indicates that the {@link #execute(Runnable)}
 * method will not execute its Runnable in the caller's thread but rather
 * asynchronously in some other thread.
