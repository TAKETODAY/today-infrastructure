/**
 * Interface representing the environment in which the current application is running.
 * Models two key aspects of the application environment: <em>profiles</em> and
 * <em>properties</em>. Methods related to property access are exposed via the
 * {@link PropertyResolver} superinterface.
 *
 * <p>A <em>profile</em> is a named, logical group of bean definitions to be registered
 * with the container only if the given profile is <em>active</em>. Beans may be assigned
 * to a profile whether defined in XML or via annotations; see the or the
 * {@link cn.taketoday.context.annotation.Profile @Profile} annotation for
 * syntax details. The role of the {@code Environment} object with relation to profiles is
 * in determining which profiles (if any) are currently {@linkplain #getActiveProfiles
 * active}, and which profiles (if any) should be {@linkplain #getDefaultProfiles active
 * by default}.
 *
 * <p><em>Properties</em> play an important role in almost all applications, and may
 * originate from a variety of sources: properties files, JVM system properties, system
 * environment variables, JNDI, servlet context parameters, ad-hoc Properties objects,
 * Maps, and so on. The role of the environment object with relation to properties is to
 * provide the user with a convenient service interface for configuring property sources
 * and resolving properties from them.
 *
 * <p>Beans managed within an {@code ApplicationContext} may register to be {@link
 * cn.taketoday.context.aware.EnvironmentAware EnvironmentAware} or {@code @Inject} the
 * {@code Environment} in order to query profile state or resolve properties directly.
 *
 *
 * <p>Configuration of the environment object must be done through the
 * {@code ConfigurableEnvironment} interface, returned from all
 * {@code AbstractApplicationContext} subclass {@code getEnvironment()} methods. See
 * {@link ConfigurableEnvironment} Javadoc for usage examples demonstrating manipulation
 * of property sources prior to application context {@code refresh()}.
