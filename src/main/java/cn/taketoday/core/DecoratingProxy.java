 * Interface to be implemented by decorating proxies, in particular AOP

 * <p>Note that this interface should just be implemented if the decorated class
 * is not within the hierarchy of the proxy class to begin with. In particular,
 * a "target-class" proxy such as an AOP CGLIB proxy should not implement
 * it since any lookup on the target class can simply be performed on the proxy
 * class there anyway.
 *
 * <p>Defined in the core module in order to allow
 * {@link OrderUtils}
 * (and potential other candidates without aop dependencies) to use it
 * for introspection purposes, in particular annotation lookups.
