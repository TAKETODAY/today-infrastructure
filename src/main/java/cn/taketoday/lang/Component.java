   * The method must have no arguments but may throw any exception.

   * method against an object returned from the {@code @Bean} method. For example, given
   * an {@code @Bean} method returning an Apache Commons DBCP {@code BasicDataSource},

   * hierarchy and will be detected regardless of the return type of the {@code @Bean}
   * method (i.e., detection occurs reflectively against the bean instance itself at
   * creation time).

   * empty string as the value, e.g. {@code @Bean(destroyMethod="")}. Note that the
   * {@link cn.taketoday.beans.factory.DisposableBean} callback interface will
   * nevertheless get detected and the corresponding destroy method invoked: In other
   * words, {@code destroyMethod=""} only affects custom close/shutdown methods and
   * {@link java.io.Closeable}/{@link java.lang.AutoCloseable} declared close methods.
   * <p>Note: Only invoked on beans whose lifecycle is under the full control of the
   * factory, which is always the case for singletons but not guaranteed for any
   * other scope.
