/**
 * Creates a proxy to a managed resource running either locally or remotely.
 * The "proxyInterface" property defines the interface that the generated
 * proxy is supposed to implement. This interface should define methods and
 * properties that correspond to operations and attributes in the management
 * interface of the resource you wish to proxy.
 *
 * <p>There is no need for the managed resource to implement the proxy interface,
 * although you may find it convenient to do. It is not required that every
 * operation and attribute in the management interface is matched by a
 * corresponding property or method in the proxy interface.
 *
 * <p>Attempting to invoke or access any method or property on the proxy
 * interface that does not correspond to the management interface will lead
 * to an {@code InvalidInvocationException}.
