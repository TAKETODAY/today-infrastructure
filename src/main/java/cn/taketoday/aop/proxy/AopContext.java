/**
 * Class containing static methods used to obtain information about the current AOP invocation.
 *
 * <p>The {@code currentProxy()} method is usable if the AOP framework is configured to
 * expose the current proxy (not the default). It returns the AOP proxy in use. Target objects
 * or advice can use this to make advised calls, in the same way as {@code getEJBObject()}
 * can be used in EJBs. They can also use it to find advice configuration.
 *
 * <p>AOP framework does not expose proxies by default, as there is a performance cost
 * in doing so.
 *
 * <p>The functionality in this class might be used by a target object that needed access
 * to resources on the invocation. However, this approach should not be used when there is
 * a reasonable alternative, as it makes application code dependent on usage under AOP and
 * the  AOP framework in particular.
