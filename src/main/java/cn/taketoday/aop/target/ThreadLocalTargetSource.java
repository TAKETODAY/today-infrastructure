/**
 * Alternative to an object pool. This {@link cn.taketoday.aop.TargetSource}
 * uses a threading model in which every thread has its own copy of the target.
 * There's no contention for targets. Target object creation is kept to a minimum
 * on the running server.
 *
 * <p>Application code is written as to a normal pool; callers can't assume they
 * will be dealing with the same instance in invocations in different threads.
 * However, state can be relied on during the operations of a single thread:
 * for example, if one caller makes repeated calls on the AOP proxy.
 *
 * <p>Cleanup of thread-bound objects is performed on BeanFactory destruction,
 * calling their {@code DisposableBean.destroy()} method if available.
 * Be aware that many thread-bound objects can be around until the application
 * actually shuts down.
