/**
 * Abstract base class for pooling {@link TargetSource}
 * implementations which maintain a pool of target instances, acquiring and
 * releasing a target object from the pool for each method invocation.
 * This abstract base class is independent of concrete pooling technology;
 * see the subclass {@link CommonsPool2TargetSource} for a concrete example.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses must implement the {@link #getTarget} and
 * {@link #releaseTarget} methods based on their chosen object pool.
 * The {@link #newPrototypeInstance()} method inherited from
 * {@link AbstractPrototypeTargetSource} can be used to create objects
 * in order to put them into the pool.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses must also implement some of the monitoring methods from the
 * {@link PoolingConfig} interface. The {@link #getPoolingConfigMixin()} method
 * makes these stats available on proxied objects through an IntroductionAdvisor.
 *
 * <p>This class implements the {@link cn.taketoday.beans.factory.DisposableBean}
 * interface in order to force subclasses to implement a {@link #destroy()}
 * method, closing down their object pool.
