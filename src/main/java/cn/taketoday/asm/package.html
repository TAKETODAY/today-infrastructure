From ASM
<br>
Provides a small and fast bytecode manipulation framework.

<p>
  The <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/">ASM</a> framework is organized
  around the {@link cn.taketoday.asm.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor},
  {@link cn.taketoday.asm.FieldVisitor FieldVisitor},
  {@link cn.taketoday.asm.MethodVisitor MethodVisitor} and
  {@link cn.taketoday.asm.AnnotationVisitor AnnotationVisitor} abstract classes,
  which allow one to visit the fields, methods and annotations of a class,
  including the bytecode instructions of each method.

<p>
  In addition to these main abstract classes, ASM provides a {@link
  cn.taketoday.asm.ClassReader ClassReader} class, that can parse an
  existing class and make a given visitor visit it. ASM also provides
  a {@link cn.taketoday.asm.ClassWriter ClassWriter} class, which is
  a visitor that generates Java class files.

<p>
  In order to generate a class from scratch, only the {@link
  cn.taketoday.asm.ClassWriter ClassWriter} class is necessary. Indeed,
  in order to generate a class, one must just call its visit<em>Xxx</em>
  methods with the appropriate arguments to generate the desired fields
  and methods.

<p>
  In order to modify existing classes, one must use a {@link
  cn.taketoday.asm.ClassReader ClassReader} class to analyze
  the original class, a class modifier, and a {@link cn.taketoday.asm.ClassWriter
  ClassWriter} to construct the modified class. The class modifier
  is just a {@link cn.taketoday.asm.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor}
  that delegates most of the work to another {@link cn.taketoday.asm.ClassVisitor
  ClassVisitor}, but that sometimes changes some parameter values,
  or call additional methods, in order to implement the desired
  modification process. In order to make it easier to implement such
  class modifiers, the {@link cn.taketoday.asm.ClassVisitor
  ClassVisitor} and {@link cn.taketoday.asm.MethodVisitor MethodVisitor}
  classes delegate by default all the method calls they receive to an
  optional visitor.
