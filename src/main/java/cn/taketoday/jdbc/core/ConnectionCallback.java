/**
 * Generic callback interface for code that operates on a JDBC Connection.
 * Allows to execute any number of operations on a single Connection,
 * using any type and number of Statements.
 *
 * <p>This is particularly useful for delegating to existing data access code
 * that expects a Connection to work on and throws SQLException. For newly
 * written code, it is strongly recommended to use JdbcTemplate's more specific
 * operations, for example a {@code query} or {@code update} variant.

   * Gets called by {@code JdbcTemplate.execute} with an active JDBC
   * Connection. Does not need to care about activating or closing the
   * Connection, or handling transactions.
   * <p>If called without a thread-bound JDBC transaction (initiated by
   * DataSourceTransactionManager), the code will simply get executed on the
   * JDBC connection with its transactional semantics. If JdbcTemplate is
   * configured to use a JTA-aware DataSource, the JDBC Connection and thus
   * the callback code will be transactional if a JTA transaction is active.
   * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
   * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's special
   * support for single step actions: see {@code JdbcTemplate.queryForObject}
   * etc. A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception:
   * it gets propagated to the caller of the template.
