/**
 * Generic callback interface for code that operates on a PreparedStatement.
 * Allows to execute any number of operations on a single PreparedStatement,
 * for example a single {@code executeUpdate} call or repeated
 * {@code executeUpdate} calls with varying parameters.
 *
 * <p>Used internally by JdbcTemplate, but also useful for application code.
 * Note that the passed-in PreparedStatement can have been created by the
 * framework or by a custom PreparedStatementCreator. However, the latter is
 * hardly ever necessary, as most custom callback actions will perform updates
 * in which case a standard PreparedStatement is fine. Custom actions will
 * always set parameter values themselves, so that PreparedStatementCreator
 * capability is not needed either.
 *
 * @param <T> the result type

  /**
   * Gets called by {@code JdbcTemplate.execute} with an active JDBC
   * PreparedStatement. Does not need to care about closing the Statement
   * or the Connection, or about handling transactions: this will all be
   * handled by Spring's JdbcTemplate.
   * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Any ResultSets opened should be closed in finally blocks
   * within the callback implementation. Spring will close the Statement
   * object after the callback returned, but this does not necessarily imply
   * that the ResultSet resources will be closed: the Statement objects might
   * get pooled by the connection pool, with {@code close} calls only
   * returning the object to the pool but not physically closing the resources.
   * <p>If called without a thread-bound JDBC transaction (initiated by
   * DataSourceTransactionManager), the code will simply get executed on the
   * JDBC connection with its transactional semantics. If JdbcTemplate is
   * configured to use a JTA-aware DataSource, the JDBC connection and thus
   * the callback code will be transactional if a JTA transaction is active.
   * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
   * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's
   * special support for single step actions: see JdbcTemplate.queryForObject etc.
   * A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception, it gets
   * propagated to the caller of the template.
