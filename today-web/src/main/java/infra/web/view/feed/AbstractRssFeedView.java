 * Abstract superclass for RSS Feed views, using the
 * <a href="https://github.com/rometools/rome">ROME</a> package.

 * <p><b>NOTE: this is based on the {@code com.rometools}

 *
 * <p>Application-specific view classes will extend this class.
 * The view will be held in the subclass itself, not in a template.
 * Main entry points are the {@link #buildFeedMetadata} and {@link #buildFeedItems}.
 *
 * <p>Thanks to Jettro Coenradie and Sergio Bossa for the original feed view prototype!
