/**
 * Abstract base class for multipart file implementations. Provides a common structure
 * and behavior for handling multipart files, including caching, transferring, and cleanup.
 * Subclasses must implement abstract methods to handle specific file operations.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to be extended by concrete implementations that provide
 * the actual logic for interacting with multipart files. It implements the {@link MultipartFile}
 * interface and extends {@link AbstractMultipart}, offering a foundation for file handling
 * in web applications or frameworks.
 *
 * <p><strong>Key Features:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Caching of file content to improve performance.</li>
 *   <li>Support for transferring files to a target location.</li>
 *   <li>Cleanup of resources after processing.</li>
 *   <li>Abstract methods for file-specific operations, allowing flexibility for different implementations.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Notes:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The {@link #transferTo(File)} method ensures that the parent directory of the destination
 *       file exists before attempting to save the file.</li>
 *   <li>The {@link #cleanup()} method clears cached bytes and invokes the abstract {@link #deleteInternal()}
 *       method to release resources.</li>
 *   <li>Subclasses should ensure thread safety if the instance is accessed concurrently.</li>
 * </ul>
