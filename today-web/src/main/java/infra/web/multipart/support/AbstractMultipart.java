/**
 * Abstract base class for handling multipart data in "multipart/form-data" requests.
 * This class provides a foundation for implementing parts of a multipart request,
 * such as form fields or file uploads. It implements the {@link Multipart} interface
 * and provides default behavior for common operations like header management and
 * string representation.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses are expected to implement specific behavior for handling multipart
 * data, such as retrieving bytes, determining if the part is a form field, or
 * cleaning up resources.
 *
 * <p><strong>Header Management:</strong>
 * The {@link #getHeaders()} method lazily initializes the headers for the part.
 * If no headers are explicitly set, it creates default headers using the
 * {@link #createHttpHeaders()} method. Subclasses can override this method to
 * customize header creation.
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong>
 * This class is not inherently thread-safe. If used in a multithreaded environment,
 * care must be taken to ensure proper synchronization when accessing or modifying
 * shared state, such as headers.
