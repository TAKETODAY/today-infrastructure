 * Annotation for mapping web requests onto methods in request-handling classes

 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> This annotation can be used both at the class and

 * prefer to use one of the HTTP method specific variants
 * {@link GetMapping @GetMapping}, {@link PostMapping @PostMapping},
 * {@link PutMapping @PutMapping}, {@link DeleteMapping @DeleteMapping}, or
 * {@link PatchMapping @PatchMapping}.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> When using controller interfaces (e.g. for AOP proxying),
 * make sure to consistently put <i>all</i> your mapping annotations - such as
 * {@code @RequestMapping} and {@code @SessionAttributes} - on
 * the controller <i>interface</i> rather than on the implementation class.
 *
 * <p>
 * like Spring's RequestMapping
