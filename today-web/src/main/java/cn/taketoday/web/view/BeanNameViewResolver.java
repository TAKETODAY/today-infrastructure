 * or in a corresponding configuration class.
 *

 * in order to allow for flexible participation in {@code ViewResolver} chaining.
 * For example, some special views could be defined via this {@code ViewResolver}
 * (giving it 0 as "order" value), while all remaining views could be resolved by
 * a {@link UrlBasedViewResolver}.
