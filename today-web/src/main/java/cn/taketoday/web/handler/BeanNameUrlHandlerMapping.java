/**
 * Implementation of the {@link HandlerMapping} interface that maps from URLs
 * to beans with names that start with a slash ("/"), similar to how Struts
 * maps URLs to action names.
 *
 * <p>This is the default implementation used by the
 * {@link cn.taketoday.web.handler.DispatcherHandler}, along with
 * {@link cn.taketoday.web.handler.method.RequestMappingHandlerMapping}.
 * Alternatively, {@link SimpleUrlHandlerMapping}
 * allows for customizing a handler mapping declaratively.
 *
 * <p>The mapping is from URL to bean name. Thus an incoming URL "/foo" would map
 * to a handler named "/foo", or to "/foo /foo2" in case of multiple mappings to
 * a single handler.
 *
 * <p>Supports direct matches (given "/test" -&gt; registered "/test") and "*"
 * matches (given "/test" -&gt; registered "/t*"). For details on the pattern
 * options, see the {@link cn.taketoday.web.util.pattern.PathPattern} javadoc.
