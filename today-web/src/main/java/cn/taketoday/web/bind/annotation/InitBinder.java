/**
 * Annotation that identifies methods which initialize the
 * {@link cn.taketoday.web.bind.WebDataBinder} which
 * will be used for populating command and form object arguments
 * of annotated handler methods.
 *
 * <p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Data binding can lead to security issues by exposing
 * parts of the object graph that are not meant to be accessed or modified by
 * external clients. Therefore the design and use of data binding should be considered
 * carefully with regard to security. For more details, please refer to the dedicated
 * sections on data binding for
 * <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#mvc-ann-initbinder-model-design">Spring Web MVC</a> and
 * <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-ann-initbinder-model-design">Spring WebFlux</a>
 * in the reference manual.
 *
 * <p>{@code @InitBinder} methods support all arguments that
 * {@link RequestMapping @RequestMapping} methods support, except for command/form
 * objects and corresponding validation result objects. {@code @InitBinder} methods
 * must not have a return value; they are usually declared as {@code void}.
 *
 * <p>Typical arguments are {@link cn.taketoday.web.bind.WebDataBinder}
 * in combination with {@link RequestContext}
 * or {@link java.util.Locale}, allowing to register context-specific editors.
