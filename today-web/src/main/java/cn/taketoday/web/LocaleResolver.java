/**
 * Interface for web-based locale resolution strategies that allows for
 * both locale resolution via the request and locale modification via
 * request and response.
 *
 * <p>This interface allows for implementations based on request, session,
 * cookies, etc. The default implementation is
 * {@link cn.taketoday.web.i18n.AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver},
 * simply using the request's locale provided by the respective HTTP header.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link cn.taketoday.web.RequestContext#getLocale()}
 * to retrieve the current locale in controllers or views, independent
 * of the actual resolution strategy.
 *
 * <p>there is an extended strategy interface
 * called {@link LocaleContextResolver}, allowing for resolution of
 * a {@link cn.taketoday.core.i18n.LocaleContext} object,
 * potentially including associated time zone information. Framework's
 * provided resolver implementations implement the extended
 * {@link LocaleContextResolver} interface wherever appropriate.
