/**
 * Filter base class that aims to guarantee a single execution per request
 * dispatch, on any servlet container. It provides a {@link #doFilterInternal}
 * method with HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse arguments.
 *
 * <p>A filter may be invoked as part of a
 * {@link jakarta.servlet.DispatcherType#REQUEST REQUEST} or
 * {@link jakarta.servlet.DispatcherType#ASYNC ASYNC} dispatches that occur in
 * separate threads. A filter can be configured in {@code web.xml} whether it
 * should be involved in async dispatches. However, in some cases servlet
 * containers assume different default configuration. Therefore sub-classes can
 * override the method {@link #shouldNotFilterAsyncDispatch()} to declare
 * statically if they should indeed be invoked, <em>once</em>, during both types
 * of dispatches in order to provide thread initialization, logging, security,
 * and so on. This mechanism complements and does not replace the need to
 * configure a filter in {@code web.xml} with dispatcher types.
 *
 * <p>Yet another dispatch type that also occurs in its own thread is
 * {@link jakarta.servlet.DispatcherType#ERROR ERROR}. Subclasses can override
 * {@link #shouldNotFilterErrorDispatch()} if they wish to declare statically
 * if they should be invoked <em>once</em> during error dispatches.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getAlreadyFilteredAttributeName} method determines how to
 * identify that a request is already filtered. The default implementation is
 * based on the configured name of the concrete filter instance.
