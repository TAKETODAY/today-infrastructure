/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects that define a mapping between
 * requests and handler objects.
 *
 * <p>This class can be implemented by application developers, although this is not
 * necessary, as {@link BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping} and {@link RequestMappingHandlerMapping}
 * are included in the framework. The former is the default if no HandlerMapping bean
 * is registered in the application context.
 *
 * <p>HandlerMapping implementations can support mapped interceptors but do not
 * have to. A handler will always be wrapped in a {@link HandlerExecutionChain}
 * instance, optionally accompanied by some {@link HandlerInterceptor} instances.
 * The DispatcherHandler will first call each HandlerInterceptor's
 * {@code preHandle} method in the given order, finally invoking the handler
 * itself if all {@code preHandle} methods have returned {@code true}.
 *
 * <p>The ability to parameterize this mapping is a powerful and unusual
 * capability of this MVC framework. For example, it is possible to write
 * a custom mapping based on session state, cookie state or many other
 * variables. No other MVC framework seems to be equally flexible.
 *
 * <p>Note: Implementations can implement the {@link Ordered}
 * interface to be able to specify a sorting order and thus a priority for getting
 * applied by DispatcherHandler. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.
