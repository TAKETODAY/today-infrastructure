/**
 * Thrown when handshake processing failed to complete due to an internal, unrecoverable
 * error. This implies a server error (HTTP status code 500) as opposed to a failure in
 * the handshake negotiation.
 *
 * <p>By contrast, when handshake negotiation fails, the response status code will be 200
 * and the response headers and body will have been updated to reflect the cause for the
 * failure. A {@link HandshakeHandler} implementation will have protected methods to
 * customize updates to the response in those cases.
