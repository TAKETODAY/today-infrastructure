/**
 * This class level annotation declares that the class it decorates
 * is a web socket endpoint that will be deployed and made available in the URI-space
 * of a web socket server. The annotation allows the developer to
 * define the URL (or URI template) which this endpoint will be published, and other
 * important properties of the endpoint to the websocket runtime, such as the encoders
 * it uses to send messages.
 *
 * <p>The annotated class
 * must have a public no-arg constructor.
 *
 * <p>For example:
 * <pre><code>
 * &#64;EndpointMapping("/hello");
 * public class HelloServer {
 *
 *     &#64;OnMessage
 *     public void processGreeting(String message, Session session) {
 *         System.out.println("Greeting received:" + message);
 *     }
 *
 * }
 * </code></pre>
