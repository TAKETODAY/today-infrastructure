/**
 * The Web Socket Handler represents an object that can handle websocket conversations.

 * overridden to intercept websocket open, error and close events. By implementing
 * the {@link WebSocketHandler#onOpen(WebSocketSession) onOpen} method
 *
 * <p>It will be instantiated once for all the connections to the server.
 *
 * <p>Here is an example of a simple endpoint that echoes any incoming text message back to the sender.

 * public class EchoWebSocketHandler extends WebSocketHandler {
