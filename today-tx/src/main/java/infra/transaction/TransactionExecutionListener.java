/**
 * Callback interface for stateless listening to transaction creation/completion steps

 * <p>In contrast to synchronizations, the transaction execution listener contract is
 * commonly supported for thread-bound transactions as well as reactive transactions.
 * The callback-provided {@link TransactionExecution} object will be either a
 * {@link TransactionStatus} (for a {@link PlatformTransactionManager} transaction) or
 * a {@link ReactiveTransaction} (for a {@link ReactiveTransactionManager} transaction).
