 * Extension of the {@link PlatformTransactionManager}
 * interface, exposing a method for executing a given callback within a transaction.
 *
 * <p>Implementors of this interface automatically express a preference for
 * callbacks over programmatic {@code getTransaction}, {@code commit}
 * and {@code rollback} calls. Calling code may check whether a given
 * transaction manager implements this interface to choose to prepare a
 * callback instead of explicit transaction demarcation control.
 *
 * <p>Framework's {@link TransactionTemplate} and
 * {@link infra.transaction.interceptor.TransactionInterceptor}
 * detect and use this PlatformTransactionManager variant automatically.
