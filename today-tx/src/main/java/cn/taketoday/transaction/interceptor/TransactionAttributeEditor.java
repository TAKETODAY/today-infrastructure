 * PropertyEditor for {@link TransactionAttribute} objects. Accepts a String of form

 * <p>{@code PROPAGATION_MANDATORY, ISOLATION_DEFAULT}

 * <p>The tokens can be in <strong>any</strong> order. Propagation and isolation codes
 * must use the names of the constants in the TransactionDefinition class. Timeout values

 * even if this exception is thrown; a "-" that they should roll back.
