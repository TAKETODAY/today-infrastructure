 * an actual new transaction gets started. As only {@link #PROPAGATION_REQUIRED},
 * {@link #PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW} and {@link #PROPAGATION_NESTED} can cause
 * that, it usually doesn't make sense to specify those settings in other cases.
 * Furthermore, be aware that not all transaction managers will support those
 * advanced features and thus might throw corresponding exceptions when given
 * non-default values.

 * whether backed by an actual resource transaction or operating non-transactionally
 * at the resource level. In the latter case, the flag will only apply to managed
 * resources within the application, such as a Hibernate {@code Session}.
