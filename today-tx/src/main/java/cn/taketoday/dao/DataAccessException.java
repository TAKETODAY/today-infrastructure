/**
 * Root of the hierarchy of data access exceptions discussed in
 * <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764543857/">Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development</a>.
 * Please see Chapter 9 of this book for detailed discussion of the
 * motivation for this package.
 *
 * <p>This exception hierarchy aims to let user code find and handle the
 * kind of error encountered without knowing the details of the particular
 * data access API in use (e.g. JDBC). Thus it is possible to react to an
 * optimistic locking failure without knowing that JDBC is being used.
 *
 * <p>As this class is a runtime exception, there is no need for user code
 * to catch it or subclasses if any error is to be considered fatal
 * (the usual case).
