/**
 * Bean post-processor that automatically applies persistence exception translation to any
 * bean marked with  @{@link cn.taketoday.stereotype.Repository Repository}
 * annotation, adding a corresponding {@link PersistenceExceptionTranslationAdvisor} to
 * the exposed proxy (either an existing AOP proxy or a newly generated proxy that
 * implements all of the target's interfaces).
 *
 * <p>Translates native resource exceptions to
 * {@link cn.taketoday.dao.DataAccessException DataAccessException} hierarchy.
 * Autodetects beans that implement the
 * {@link cn.taketoday.dao.support.PersistenceExceptionTranslator
 * PersistenceExceptionTranslator} interface, which are subsequently asked to translate
 * candidate exceptions.
 *
 * <p>All of  applicable resource factories (e.g.
 * {@link cn.taketoday.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean})
 * implement the {@code PersistenceExceptionTranslator} interface out of the box.
 * As a consequence, all that is usually needed to enable automatic exception
 * translation is marking all affected beans (such as Repositories or DAOs)
 * with the {@code @Repository} annotation, along with defining this post-processor
 * as a bean in the application context.
 *
 * <p>{@code PersistenceExceptionTranslator} beans will be sorted according
 * to  dependency ordering rules: see {@link cn.taketoday.core.Ordered}
 * and {@link Order}. Note that such beans will
 * get retrieved from any scope, not just singleton scope
