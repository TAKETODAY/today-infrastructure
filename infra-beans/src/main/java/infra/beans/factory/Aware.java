/**
 * A marker superinterface indicating that a bean is eligible to be notified by the
 * Infra container of a particular framework object through a callback-style method.
 * The actual method signature is determined by individual sub-interfaces but should
 * typically consist of just one void-returning method that accepts a single argument.
 *
 * <p>Note that merely implementing {@link Aware} provides no default functionality.
 * Rather, processing must be done explicitly, for example in a
 * {@link BeanPostProcessor}.
 * Refer to {@link infra.context.support.ContextAwareProcessor}
 * for an example of processing specific {@code *Aware} interface callbacks.
