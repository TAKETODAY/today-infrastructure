/**
 * Strategy interface for creating {@link BeanInfo} instances for Framework beans.
 * Can be used to plug in custom bean property resolution strategies (e.g. for other
 * languages on the JVM) or more efficient {@link BeanInfo} retrieval algorithms.
 *
 * <p>BeanInfoFactories are instantiated by the {@link CachedIntrospectionResults},
 * by using the {@link TodayStrategies} utility class.
 *
 * When a {@link BeanInfo} is to be created, the {@code CachedIntrospectionResults}
 * will iterate through the discovered factories, calling {@link #getBeanInfo(Class)}
 * on each one. If {@code null} is returned, the next factory will be queried.
 * If none of the factories support the class, a standard {@link BeanInfo} will be
 * created as a default.
 *
 * <p>Note that the {@link TodayStrategies} sorts the {@code
 * BeanInfoFactory} instances by {@link Order @Order}, so that ones with a
 * higher precedence come first.
