  /**
   * Gets called by {@code JdbcTemplate.execute} with an active JDBC
   * Statement. Does not need to care about closing the Statement or the
   * Connection, or about handling transactions: this will all be handled
   * by Framework's JdbcTemplate.
   * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Any ResultSets opened should be closed in finally blocks
   * within the callback implementation. Framework will close the Statement
   * object after the callback returned, but this does not necessarily imply
   * that the ResultSet resources will be closed: the Statement objects might
   * get pooled by the connection pool, with {@code close} calls only
   * returning the object to the pool but not physically closing the resources.
   * <p>If called without a thread-bound JDBC transaction (initiated by
   * DataSourceTransactionManager), the code will simply get executed on the
   * JDBC connection with its transactional semantics. If JdbcTemplate is
   * configured to use a JTA-aware DataSource, the JDBC connection and thus
   * the callback code will be transactional if a JTA transaction is active.
   * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
   * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's
   * special support for single step actions: see JdbcTemplate.queryForObject etc.
   * A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception, it gets
   * propagated to the caller of the template.
   *
