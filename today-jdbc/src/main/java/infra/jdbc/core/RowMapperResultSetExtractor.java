/**
 * Adapter implementation of the ResultSetExtractor interface that delegates
 * to a RowMapper which is supposed to create an object for each row.
 * Each object is added to the results List of this ResultSetExtractor.
 *
 * <p>Useful for the typical case of one object per row in the database table.
 * The number of entries in the results list will match the number of rows.
 *
 * <p>Note that a RowMapper object is typically stateless and thus reusable;
 * just the RowMapperResultSetExtractor adapter is stateful.
 *
 * <p>A usage example with JdbcTemplate:
 *
 * <pre class="code">JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);  // reusable object
 * RowMapper rowMapper = new UserRowMapper();  // reusable object
 *
 * List allUsers = (List) jdbcTemplate.query(
 *     "select * from user",
 *     new RowMapperResultSetExtractor(rowMapper, 10));
 *
 * User user = (User) jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(
 *     "select * from user where id=?", new Object[] {id},
 *     new RowMapperResultSetExtractor(rowMapper, 1));</pre>
 *
 * <p>Alternatively, consider subclassing MappingSqlQuery from the {@code jdbc.object}
 * package: Instead of working with separate JdbcTemplate and RowMapper objects,
 * you can have executable query objects (containing row-mapping logic) there.
