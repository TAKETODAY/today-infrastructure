/**
 * Reusable RDBMS query in which concrete subclasses must implement
 * the abstract mapRow(ResultSet, int) method to map each row of
 * the JDBC ResultSet into an object.
 *
 * <p>Such manual mapping is usually preferable to "automatic"
 * mapping using reflection, which can become complex in non-trivial
 * cases. For example, the present class allows different objects
 * to be used for different rows (for example, if a subclass is indicated).
 * It allows computed fields to be set. And there's no need for
 * ResultSet columns to have the same names as bean properties.
 * The Pareto Principle in action: going the extra mile to automate
 * the extraction process makes the framework much more complex
 * and delivers little real benefit.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses can be constructed providing SQL, parameter types
 * and a DataSource. SQL will often vary between subclasses.
