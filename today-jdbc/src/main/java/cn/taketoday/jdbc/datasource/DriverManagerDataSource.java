/**
 * Simple implementation of the standard JDBC {@link javax.sql.DataSource} interface,
 * configuring the plain old JDBC {@link DriverManager} via bean properties, and
 * returning a new {@link Connection} from every {@code getConnection} call.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE: This class is not an actual connection pool; it does not actually
 * pool Connections.</b> It just serves as simple replacement for a full-blown
 * connection pool, implementing the same standard interface, but creating new
 * Connections on every call.
 *
 * <p>Useful for test or standalone environments outside of a Jakarta EE container, either
 * as a DataSource bean in a corresponding ApplicationContext or in conjunction with
 * a simple JNDI environment. Pool-assuming {@code Connection.close()} calls will
 * simply close the Connection, so any DataSource-aware persistence code should work.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE: Within special class loading environments such as OSGi, this class
 * is effectively superseded by {@link SimpleDriverDataSource} due to general class
 * loading issues with the JDBC DriverManager that be resolved through direct Driver
 * usage (which is exactly what SimpleDriverDataSource does).</b>
 *
 * <p>In a Jakarta EE container, it is recommended to use a JNDI DataSource provided by
 * the container. Such a DataSource can be exposed as a DataSource bean in a Framework
 * ApplicationContext via {@link cn.taketoday.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean},
 * for seamless switching to and from a local DataSource bean like this class.
 * For tests, you can then either set up a mock JNDI environment through complete
 * solutions from third parties such as <a href="https://github.com/h-thurow/Simple-JNDI">Simple-JNDI</a>,
 * or switch the bean definition to a local DataSource (which is simpler and thus recommended).
 *
 * <p>This {@code DriverManagerDataSource} class was originally designed alongside
 * <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp">Apache Commons DBCP</a>
 * and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c3p0">C3P0</a>, featuring bean-style
 * {@code BasicDataSource}/{@code ComboPooledDataSource} classes with configuration
 * properties for local resource setups. For a modern JDBC connection pool, consider
 * <a href="https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP">HikariCP</a> instead,
 * exposing a corresponding {@code HikariDataSource} instance to the application.
