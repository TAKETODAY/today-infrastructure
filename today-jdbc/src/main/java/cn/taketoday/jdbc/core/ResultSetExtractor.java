/**
 * Callback interface used by {@link JdbcTemplate}'s query methods.
 * Implementations of this interface perform the actual work of extracting
 * results from a {@link ResultSet}, but don't need to worry
 * about exception handling. {@link SQLException SQLExceptions}
 * will be caught and handled by the calling JdbcTemplate.
 *
 * <p>This interface is mainly used within the JDBC framework itself.
 * A {@link RowMapper} is usually a simpler choice for ResultSet processing,
 * mapping one result object per row instead of one result object for
 * the entire ResultSet.
 *
 * <p>Note: In contrast to a {@link RowCallbackHandler}, a ResultSetExtractor
 * object is typically stateless and thus reusable, as long as it doesn't
 * access stateful resources (such as output streams when streaming LOB
 * contents) or keep result state within the object.
