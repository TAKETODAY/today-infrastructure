/**
 * An interface used by {@link JdbcTemplate} for mapping rows of a
 * {@link ResultSet} on a per-row basis. Implementations of this
 * interface perform the actual work of mapping each row to a result object,
 * but don't need to worry about exception handling.
 * {@link SQLException SQLExceptions} will be caught and handled
 * by the calling JdbcTemplate.
 *
 * <p>Typically used either for {@link JdbcTemplate}'s query methods
 * or for out parameters of stored procedures. RowMapper objects are
 * typically stateless and thus reusable; they are an ideal choice for
 * implementing row-mapping logic in a single place.
 *
 * <p>Alternatively, consider subclassing
 * {@link cn.taketoday.jdbc.object.MappingSqlQuery} from the
 * {@code jdbc.object} package: Instead of working with separate
 * JdbcTemplate and RowMapper objects, you can build executable query
 * objects (containing row-mapping logic) in that style.
