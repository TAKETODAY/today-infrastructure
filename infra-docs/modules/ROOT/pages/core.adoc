This part of the reference documentation covers all the technologies that are
absolutely integral to the TODAY Framework.

Foremost amongst these is the TODAY Framework's Inversion of Control (IoC) container.
A thorough treatment of the TODAY Framework's IoC container is closely followed by
comprehensive coverage of Infra Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technologies.
The TODAY Framework has its own AOP framework, which is conceptually easy to
understand and which successfully addresses the 80% sweet spot of AOP requirements
in Java enterprise programming.

Coverage of Infra integration with AspectJ (currently the richest -- in terms of
features -- and certainly most mature AOP implementation in the Java enterprise space)
is also provided.

AOT processing can be used to optimize your application ahead-of-time. It is typically
used for native image deployment using GraalVM.
