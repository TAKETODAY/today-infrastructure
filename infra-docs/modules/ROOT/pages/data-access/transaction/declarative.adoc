= Declarative Transaction Management

NOTE: Most TODAY Framework users choose declarative transaction management. This option has
the least impact on application code and, hence, is most consistent with the ideals of a
non-invasive lightweight container.

The TODAY Framework's declarative transaction management is made possible with Infra
aspect-oriented programming (AOP). However, as the transactional aspects code comes
with the TODAY Framework distribution and may be used in a boilerplate fashion, AOP
concepts do not generally have to be understood to make effective use of this code.

The TODAY Framework's declarative transaction management is similar to EJB CMT, in that
you can specify transaction behavior (or lack of it) down to the individual method level.
You can make a `setRollbackOnly()` call within a transaction context, if
necessary. The differences between the two types of transaction management are:

* Unlike EJB CMT, which is tied to JTA, the TODAY Framework's declarative transaction
  management works in any environment. It can work with JTA transactions or local
  transactions by using JDBC, JPA, or Hibernate by adjusting the configuration
  files.
* You can apply the TODAY Framework declarative transaction management to any class,
  not merely special classes such as EJBs.
* The TODAY Framework offers declarative
  xref:data-access/transaction/declarative/rolling-back.adoc[rollback rules], a feature with no EJB
  equivalent. Both programmatic and declarative support for rollback rules is provided.
* The TODAY Framework lets you customize transactional behavior by using AOP.
  For example, you can insert custom behavior in the case of transaction rollback. You
  can also add arbitrary advice, along with transactional advice. With EJB CMT, you
  cannot influence the container's transaction management, except with
  `setRollbackOnly()`.
* The TODAY Framework does not support propagation of transaction contexts across
  remote calls, as high-end application servers do. If you need this feature, we
  recommend that you use EJB. However, consider carefully before using such a feature,
  because, normally, one does not want transactions to span remote calls.

The concept of rollback rules is important. They let you specify which exceptions
(and throwables) should cause automatic rollback. You can specify this declaratively, in
configuration, not in Java code. So, although you can still call `setRollbackOnly()` on
the `TransactionStatus` object to roll back the current transaction back, most often you
can specify a rule that `MyApplicationException` must always result in rollback. The
significant advantage to this option is that business objects do not depend on the
transaction infrastructure. For example, they typically do not need to import Infra
transaction APIs or other Infra APIs.

Although EJB container default behavior automatically rolls back the transaction on a
system exception (usually a runtime exception), EJB CMT does not roll back the
transaction automatically on an application exception (that is, a checked exception
other than `java.rmi.RemoteException`). While the Infra default behavior for
declarative transaction management follows EJB convention (roll back is automatic only
on unchecked exceptions), it is often useful to customize this behavior.
