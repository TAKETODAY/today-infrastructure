== Using the Wrong Transaction Manager for a Specific `DataSource`

Use the correct `PlatformTransactionManager` implementation based on your choice of
transactional technologies and requirements. Used properly, the TODAY Framework merely
provides a straightforward and portable abstraction. If you use global
transactions, you must use the
`infra.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager` class (or an
xref:data-access/transaction/application-server-integration.adoc[application server-specific subclass] of
it) for all your transactional operations. Otherwise, the transaction infrastructure
tries to perform local transactions on such resources as container `DataSource`
instances. Such local transactions do not make sense, and a good application server
treats them as errors.
