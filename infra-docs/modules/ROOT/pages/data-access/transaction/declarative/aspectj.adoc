= Using `@Transactional` with AspectJ

You can also use the TODAY Framework's `@Transactional` support outside of a Spring
container by means of an AspectJ aspect. To do so, first annotate your classes
(and optionally your classes' methods) with the `@Transactional` annotation,
and then link (weave) your application with the
`cn.taketoday.transaction.aspectj.AnnotationTransactionAspect` defined in the
`spring-aspects.jar` file. You must also configure the aspect with a transaction
manager. You can use the TODAY Framework's IoC container to take care of
dependency-injecting the aspect. The simplest way to configure the transaction
management aspect is to use the `<tx:annotation-driven/>` element and specify the `mode`
attribute to `aspectj` as described in xref:data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.adoc[Using `@Transactional`]. Because
we focus here on applications that run outside of a Spring container, we show
you how to do it programmatically.

NOTE: Prior to continuing, you may want to read xref:data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.adoc[Using `@Transactional`] and
xref:core/aop.adoc[AOP] respectively.

The following example shows how to create a transaction manager and configure the
`AnnotationTransactionAspect` to use it:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	// construct an appropriate transaction manager
	DataSourceTransactionManager txManager = new DataSourceTransactionManager(getDataSource());

	// configure the AnnotationTransactionAspect to use it; this must be done before executing any transactional methods
	AnnotationTransactionAspect.aspectOf().setTransactionManager(txManager);
----

======

NOTE: When you use this aspect, you must annotate the implementation class (or the methods
within that class or both), not the interface (if any) that the class implements. AspectJ
follows Java's rule that annotations on interfaces are not inherited.

The `@Transactional` annotation on a class specifies the default transaction semantics
for the execution of any public method in the class.

The `@Transactional` annotation on a method within the class overrides the default
transaction semantics given by the class annotation (if present). You can annotate any method,
regardless of visibility.

To weave your applications with the `AnnotationTransactionAspect`, you must either build
your application with AspectJ (see the {aspectj-docs-devguide}/index.html[AspectJ Development
Guide]) or use load-time weaving. See xref:core/aop/using-aspectj.adoc#aop-aj-ltw[Load-time weaving with AspectJ in the TODAY Framework]
 for a discussion of load-time weaving with AspectJ.
