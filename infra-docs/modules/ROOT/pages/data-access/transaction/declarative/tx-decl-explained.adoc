= Understanding the TODAY Framework's Declarative Transaction Implementation

It is not sufficient merely to tell you to annotate your classes with the
`@Transactional` annotation, add `@EnableTransactionManagement` to your configuration,
and expect you to understand how it all works. To provide a deeper understanding, this
section explains the inner workings of the TODAY Framework's declarative transaction
infrastructure in the context of transaction-related issues.

The most important concepts to grasp with regard to the TODAY Framework's declarative
transaction support are that this support is enabled
xref:core/aop/proxying.adoc#aop-understanding-aop-proxies[via AOP proxies] and that the transactional
advice is driven by metadata (currently XML- or annotation-based). The combination of AOP
with transactional metadata yields an AOP proxy that uses a `TransactionInterceptor` in
conjunction with an appropriate `TransactionManager` implementation to drive transactions
around method invocations.

NOTE: Infra AOP is covered in xref:core/aop.adoc[the AOP section].

TODAY Framework's `TransactionInterceptor` provides transaction management for
imperative and reactive programming models. The interceptor detects the desired flavor of
transaction management by inspecting the method return type. Methods returning a reactive
type such as `Publisher` or Kotlin `Flow` (or a subtype of those) qualify for reactive
transaction management. All other return types including `void` use the code path for
imperative transaction management.

Transaction management flavors impact which transaction manager is required. Imperative
transactions require a `PlatformTransactionManager`, while reactive transactions use
`ReactiveTransactionManager` implementations.

[NOTE]
====
`@Transactional` commonly works with thread-bound transactions managed by
`PlatformTransactionManager`, exposing a transaction to all data access operations within
the current execution thread. Note: This does _not_ propagate to newly started threads
within the method.

A reactive transaction managed by `ReactiveTransactionManager` uses the Reactor context
instead of thread-local attributes. As a consequence, all participating data access
operations need to execute within the same Reactor context in the same reactive pipeline.

When configured with a `ReactiveTransactionManager`, all transaction-demarcated methods
are expected to return a reactive pipeline. Void methods or regular return types need
to be associated with a regular `PlatformTransactionManager`, e.g. through the
`transactionManager` attribute of the corresponding `@Transactional` declarations.
