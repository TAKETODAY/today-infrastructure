= Example of Declarative Transaction Implementation

Consider the following interface and its attendant implementation. This example uses
`Foo` and `Bar` classes as placeholders so that you can concentrate on the transaction
usage without focusing on a particular domain model. For the purposes of this example,
the fact that the `DefaultFooService` class throws `UnsupportedOperationException`
instances in the body of each implemented method is good. That behavior lets you see
transactions being created and then rolled back in response to the
`UnsupportedOperationException` instance. The following listing shows the `FooService`
interface:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary",chomp="-packages"]
----
// the service interface that we want to make transactional

package x.y.service;

public interface FooService {

  Foo getFoo(String fooName);

  Foo getFoo(String fooName, String barName);

  void insertFoo(Foo foo);

  void updateFoo(Foo foo);

}
----

The following example shows an implementation of the preceding interface:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary",chomp="-packages"]
----
package x.y.service;

public class DefaultFooService implements FooService {

  @Override
  public Foo getFoo(String fooName) {
    // ...
  }

  @Override
  public Foo getFoo(String fooName, String barName) {
    // ...
  }

  @Override
  public void insertFoo(Foo foo) {
    // ...
  }

  @Override
  public void updateFoo(Foo foo) {
    // ...
  }
}
----

======

Assume that the first two methods of the `FooService` interface, `getFoo(String)` and
`getFoo(String, String)`, must run in the context of a transaction with read-only
semantics and that the other methods, `insertFoo(Foo)` and `updateFoo(Foo)`, must
run in the context of a transaction with read-write semantics. The following
configuration is explained in detail in the next few paragraphs:

Examine the preceding configuration. It assumes that you want to make a service object,
the `fooService` bean, transactional. The transaction semantics to apply are encapsulated
in the `<tx:advice/>` definition. The `<tx:advice/>` definition reads as "all methods
starting with `get` are to run in the context of a read-only transaction, and all
other methods are to run with the default transaction semantics". The
`transaction-manager` attribute of the `<tx:advice/>` tag is set to the name of the
`TransactionManager` bean that is going to drive the transactions (in this case, the
`txManager` bean).

TIP: You can omit the `transaction-manager` attribute in the transactional advice
(`<tx:advice/>`) if the bean name of the `TransactionManager` that you want to
wire in has the name `transactionManager`. If the `TransactionManager` bean that
you want to wire in has any other name, you must use the `transaction-manager`
attribute explicitly, as in the preceding example.

The `<aop:config/>` definition ensures that the transactional advice defined by the
`txAdvice` bean runs at the appropriate points in the program. First, you define a
pointcut that matches the execution of any operation defined in the `FooService` interface
(`fooServiceOperation`). Then you associate the pointcut with the `txAdvice` by using an
advisor. The result indicates that, at the execution of a `fooServiceOperation`,
the advice defined by `txAdvice` is run.

The expression defined within the `<aop:pointcut/>` element is an AspectJ pointcut
expression. See xref:core/aop.adoc[the AOP section] for more details on pointcut
expressions in Infra.

A common requirement is to make an entire service layer transactional. The best way to
do this is to change the pointcut expression to match any operation in your
service layer. The following example shows how to do so:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
<aop:config>
  <aop:pointcut id="fooServiceMethods" expression="execution(* x.y.service.*.*(..))"/>
  <aop:advisor advice-ref="txAdvice" pointcut-ref="fooServiceMethods"/>
</aop:config>
----

NOTE: In the preceding example, it is assumed that all your service interfaces are defined
in the `x.y.service` package. See xref:core/aop.adoc[the AOP section] for more details.

Now that we have analyzed the configuration, you may be asking yourself,
"What does all this configuration actually do?"

The configuration shown earlier is used to create a transactional proxy around the object
that is created from the `fooService` bean definition. The proxy is configured with
the transactional advice so that, when an appropriate method is invoked on the proxy,
a transaction is started, suspended, marked as read-only, and so on, depending on the
transaction configuration associated with that method. Consider the following program
that test drives the configuration shown earlier:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public final class Boot {

  public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {
    ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("context.xml");
    FooService fooService = ctx.getBean(FooService.class);
    fooService.insertFoo(new Foo());
  }
}
----

======

The output from running the preceding program should resemble the following (the Log4J
output and the stack trace from the `UnsupportedOperationException` thrown by the
`insertFoo(..)` method of the `DefaultFooService` class have been truncated for clarity):

To use reactive transaction management the code has to use reactive types.

NOTE: TODAY Framework uses the `ReactiveAdapterRegistry` to determine whether a method
return type is reactive.

The following listing shows a modified version of the previously used `FooService`, but
this time the code uses reactive types:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary",chomp="-packages"]
----
// the reactive service interface that we want to make transactional

package x.y.service;

public interface FooService {

  Flux<Foo> getFoo(String fooName);

  Publisher<Foo> getFoo(String fooName, String barName);

  Mono<Void> insertFoo(Foo foo);

  Mono<Void> updateFoo(Foo foo);

}
----

======

The following example shows an implementation of the preceding interface:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary",chomp="-packages"]
----
package x.y.service;

public class DefaultFooService implements FooService {

  @Override
  public Flux<Foo> getFoo(String fooName) {
    // ...
  }

  @Override
  public Publisher<Foo> getFoo(String fooName, String barName) {
    // ...
  }

  @Override
  public Mono<Void> insertFoo(Foo foo) {
    // ...
  }

  @Override
  public Mono<Void> updateFoo(Foo foo) {
    // ...
  }
}

Imperative and reactive transaction management share the same semantics for transaction
boundary and transaction attribute definitions. The main difference between imperative
and reactive transactions is the deferred nature of the latter. `TransactionInterceptor`
decorates the returned reactive type with a transactional operator to begin and clean up
the transaction. Therefore, calling a transactional reactive method defers the actual
transaction management to a subscription type that activates processing of the reactive
type.

Another aspect of reactive transaction management relates to data escaping which is a
natural consequence of the programming model.

Method return values of imperative transactions are returned from transactional methods
upon successful termination of a method so that partially computed results do not escape
the method closure.

Reactive transaction methods return a reactive wrapper type which represents a
computation sequence along with a promise to begin and complete the computation.

A `Publisher` can emit data while a transaction is ongoing but not necessarily completed.
Therefore, methods that depend upon successful completion of an entire transaction need
to ensure completion and buffer results in the calling code.
