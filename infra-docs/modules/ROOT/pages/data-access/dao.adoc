= DAO Support

The Data Access Object (DAO) support in Spring is aimed at making it easy to work with
data access technologies (such as JDBC, Hibernate, or JPA) in a consistent way. This
lets you switch between the aforementioned persistence technologies fairly easily,
and it also lets you code without worrying about catching exceptions that are
specific to each technology.



[[dao-exceptions]]
== Consistent Exception Hierarchy

Spring provides a convenient translation from technology-specific exceptions, such as
`SQLException` to its own exception class hierarchy, which has `DataAccessException` as
the root exception. These exceptions wrap the original exception so that there is never
any risk that you might lose any information about what might have gone wrong.

In addition to JDBC exceptions, Spring can also wrap JPA- and Hibernate-specific exceptions,
converting them to a set of focused runtime exceptions. This lets you handle most
non-recoverable persistence exceptions in only the appropriate layers, without having
annoying boilerplate catch-and-throw blocks and exception declarations in your DAOs.
(You can still trap and handle exceptions anywhere you need to though.) As mentioned above,
JDBC exceptions (including database-specific dialects) are also converted to the same
hierarchy, meaning that you can perform some operations with JDBC within a consistent
programming model.

The preceding discussion holds true for the various template classes in Spring's support
for various ORM frameworks. If you use the interceptor-based classes, the application must
care about handling `HibernateExceptions` and `PersistenceExceptions` itself, preferably by
delegating to the `convertHibernateAccessException(..)` or `convertJpaAccessException(..)`
methods, respectively, of `SessionFactoryUtils`. These methods convert the exceptions
to exceptions that are compatible with the exceptions in the `cn.taketoday.dao`
exception hierarchy. As `PersistenceExceptions` are unchecked, they can get thrown, too
(sacrificing generic DAO abstraction in terms of exceptions, though).

The following image shows the exception hierarchy that Spring provides.
(Note that the class hierarchy detailed in the image shows only a subset of the entire
`DataAccessException` hierarchy.)

[[dao-annotations]]
== Annotations Used to Configure DAO or Repository Classes

The best way to guarantee that your Data Access Objects (DAOs) or repositories provide
exception translation is to use the `@Repository` annotation. This annotation also
lets the component scanning support find and configure your DAOs and repositories
without having to provide XML configuration entries for them. The following example shows
how to use the `@Repository` annotation:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Repository // <1>
public class SomeMovieFinder implements MovieFinder {
  // ...
}
----
<1> The `@Repository` annotation.
======


Any DAO or repository implementation needs access to a persistence resource,
depending on the persistence technology used. For example, a JDBC-based repository
needs access to a JDBC `DataSource`, and a JPA-based repository needs access to an
`EntityManager`. The easiest way to accomplish this is to have this resource dependency
injected by using one of the `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, `@Resource` or `@PersistenceContext`
annotations. The following example works for a JPA repository:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Repository
public class JpaMovieFinder implements MovieFinder {

  @PersistenceContext
  private EntityManager entityManager;

  // ...
}
----
======


If you use the classic Hibernate APIs, you can inject `SessionFactory`, as the following
example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Repository
public class HibernateMovieFinder implements MovieFinder {

  private SessionFactory sessionFactory;

  @Autowired
  public void setSessionFactory(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
    this.sessionFactory = sessionFactory;
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

The last example we show here is for typical JDBC support. You could have the `DataSource`
injected into an initialization method or a constructor, where you would create a `JdbcTemplate`
and other data access support classes (such as `SimpleJdbcCall` and others) by using this
`DataSource`. The following example autowires a `DataSource`:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Repository
public class JdbcMovieFinder implements MovieFinder {

  private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

  @Autowired
  public void init(DataSource dataSource) {
    this.jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

NOTE: See the specific coverage of each persistence technology for details on how to
configure the application context to take advantage of these annotations.
