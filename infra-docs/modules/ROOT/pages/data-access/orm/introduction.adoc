= Introduction to ORM with Infra

The TODAY Framework supports integration with the Java Persistence API (JPA) and
supports native Hibernate for resource management, data access object (DAO) implementations,
and transaction strategies. For example, for Hibernate, there is first-class support with
several convenient IoC features that address many typical Hibernate integration issues.
You can configure all of the supported features for OR (object relational) mapping
tools through Dependency Injection. They can participate in Infra resource and
transaction management, and they comply with Infra generic transaction and DAO
exception hierarchies. The recommended integration style is to code DAOs against plain
Hibernate or JPA APIs.

Infra adds significant enhancements to the ORM layer of your choice when you create
data access applications. You can leverage as much of the integration support as you
wish, and you should compare this integration effort with the cost and risk of building
a similar infrastructure in-house. You can use much of the ORM support as you would a
library, regardless of technology, because everything is designed as a set of reusable
JavaBeans. ORM in a Infra IoC container facilitates configuration and deployment. Thus,
most examples in this section show configuration inside a Infra container.

The benefits of using the TODAY Framework to create your ORM DAOs include:

* *Easier testing.* Infra IoC approach makes it easy to swap the implementations
  and configuration locations of Hibernate `SessionFactory` instances, JDBC `DataSource`
  instances, transaction managers, and mapped object implementations (if needed). This
  in turn makes it much easier to test each piece of persistence-related code in
  isolation.
* *Common data access exceptions.* Infra can wrap exceptions from your ORM tool,
  converting them from proprietary (potentially checked) exceptions to a common runtime
  `DataAccessException` hierarchy. This feature lets you handle most persistence
  exceptions, which are non-recoverable, only in the appropriate layers, without
  annoying boilerplate catches, throws, and exception declarations. You can still trap
  and handle exceptions as necessary. Remember that JDBC exceptions (including
  DB-specific dialects) are also converted to the same hierarchy, meaning that you can
  perform some operations with JDBC within a consistent programming model.
* *General resource management.* Infra application contexts can handle the location
  and configuration of Hibernate `SessionFactory` instances, JPA `EntityManagerFactory`
  instances, JDBC `DataSource` instances, and other related resources. This makes these
  values easy to manage and change. Infra offers efficient, easy, and safe handling of
  persistence resources. For example, related code that uses Hibernate generally needs to
  use the same Hibernate `Session` to ensure efficiency and proper transaction handling.
  Infra makes it easy to create and bind a `Session` to the current thread transparently,
  by exposing a current `Session` through the Hibernate `SessionFactory`. Thus, Infra
  solves many chronic problems of typical Hibernate usage, for any local or JTA
  transaction environment.
* *Integrated transaction management.* You can wrap your ORM code with a declarative,
  aspect-oriented programming (AOP) style method interceptor either through the
  `@Transactional` annotation or by explicitly configuring the transaction AOP advice in
  an XML configuration file. In both cases, transaction semantics and exception handling
  (rollback and so on) are handled for you. As discussed in xref:data-access/orm/general.adoc#orm-resource-mngmnt[Resource and Transaction Management],
  you can also swap various transaction managers, without affecting your ORM-related code.
  For example, you can swap between local transactions and JTA, with the same full services
  (such as declarative transactions) available in both scenarios. Additionally,
  JDBC-related code can fully integrate transactionally with the code you use to do ORM.
  This is useful for data access that is not suitable for ORM (such as batch processing and
  BLOB streaming) but that still needs to share common transactions with ORM operations.

TIP: For more comprehensive ORM support, including support for alternative database
technologies such as MongoDB, you might want to check out the
{today-tech-site-projects}/spring-data/[Infra Data] suite of projects. If you are
a JPA user, the {today-tech-site-guides}/gs/accessing-data-jpa/[Getting Started Accessing
Data with JPA] guide from https://spring.io provides a great introduction.
