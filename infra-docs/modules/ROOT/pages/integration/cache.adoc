= Cache Abstraction
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Since version 3.1, the Spring Framework provides support for transparently adding caching to
an existing Spring application. Similar to the xref:data-access/transaction.adoc[transaction]
support, the caching abstraction allows consistent use of various caching solutions with
minimal impact on the code.

In Spring Framework 4.1, the cache abstraction was significantly extended with support
for xref:integration/cache/jsr-107.adoc[JSR-107 annotations] and more customization options.
