Directly through your cache provider. The cache abstraction is an abstraction,
not a cache implementation. The solution you use might support various data
policies and different topologies that other solutions do not support (for example,
the JDK `ConcurrentHashMap` -- exposing that in the cache abstraction would be useless
because there would no backing support). Such functionality should be controlled
directly through the backing cache (when configuring it) or through its native API.
