[[jmx-exporting]]
= Exporting Your Beans to JMX

The core class in Infra JMX framework is the `MBeanExporter`. This class is
responsible for taking your Infra beans and registering them with a JMX `MBeanServer`.
For example, consider the following class:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",chomp="-packages",chomp="-packages"]
----
package cn.taketoday.jmx;

public class JmxTestBean implements IJmxTestBean {

  private String name;
  private int age;
  private boolean isSuperman;

  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }

  public void setAge(int age) {
    this.age = age;
  }

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  }

  public void dontExposeMe() {
    throw new RuntimeException();
  }
}
----

To expose the properties and methods of this bean as attributes and operations of an
MBean, you can configure an instance of the `MBeanExporter` class in your
configuration file and pass in the bean, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans>
  <!-- this bean must not be lazily initialized if the exporting is to happen -->
  <bean id="exporter" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.export.MBeanExporter" lazy-init="false">
    <property name="beans">
      <map>
        <entry key="bean:name=testBean1" value-ref="testBean"/>
      </map>
    </property>
  </bean>
  <bean id="testBean" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.JmxTestBean">
    <property name="name" value="TEST"/>
    <property name="age" value="100"/>
  </bean>
</beans>
----

The pertinent bean definition from the preceding configuration snippet is the `exporter`
bean. The `beans` property tells the `MBeanExporter` exactly which of your beans must be
exported to the JMX `MBeanServer`. In the default configuration, the key of each entry
in the `beans` `Map` is used as the `ObjectName` for the bean referenced by the
corresponding entry value. You can change this behavior, as described in xref:integration/jmx/naming.adoc[Controlling  `ObjectName` Instances for Your Beans].

With this configuration, the `testBean` bean is exposed as an MBean under the
`ObjectName` `bean:name=testBean1`. By default, all `public` properties of the bean
are exposed as attributes and all `public` methods (except those inherited from the
`Object` class) are exposed as operations.

NOTE: `MBeanExporter` is a `Lifecycle` bean (see xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc#beans-factory-lifecycle-processor[Startup and Shutdown Callbacks]
). By default, MBeans are exported as late as possible during
the application lifecycle. You can configure the `phase` at which
the export happens or disable automatic registration by setting the `autoStartup` flag.


[[jmx-exporting-mbeanserver]]
== Creating an MBeanServer

The configuration shown in the xref:integration/jmx/exporting.adoc[preceding section] assumes that the
application is running in an environment that has one (and only one) `MBeanServer`
already running. In this case, Infra tries to locate the running `MBeanServer` and
register your beans with that server (if any). This behavior is useful when your
application runs inside a container (such as Tomcat or IBM WebSphere) that has its
own `MBeanServer`.

However, this approach is of no use in a standalone environment or when running inside
a container that does not provide an `MBeanServer`. To address this, you can create an
`MBeanServer` instance declaratively by adding an instance of the
`cn.taketoday.jmx.support.MBeanServerFactoryBean` class to your configuration.
You can also ensure that a specific `MBeanServer` is used by setting the value of the
`MBeanExporter` instance's `server` property to the `MBeanServer` value returned by an
`MBeanServerFactoryBean`, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans>

  <bean id="mbeanServer" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.support.MBeanServerFactoryBean"/>

  <!--
  this bean needs to be eagerly pre-instantiated in order for the exporting to occur;
  this means that it must not be marked as lazily initialized
  -->
  <bean id="exporter" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.export.MBeanExporter">
    <property name="beans">
      <map>
        <entry key="bean:name=testBean1" value-ref="testBean"/>
      </map>
    </property>
    <property name="server" ref="mbeanServer"/>
  </bean>

  <bean id="testBean" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.JmxTestBean">
    <property name="name" value="TEST"/>
    <property name="age" value="100"/>
  </bean>

</beans>
----

In the preceding example, an instance of `MBeanServer` is created by the `MBeanServerFactoryBean` and is
supplied to the `MBeanExporter` through the `server` property. When you supply your own
`MBeanServer` instance, the `MBeanExporter` does not try to locate a running
`MBeanServer` and uses the supplied `MBeanServer` instance. For this to work
correctly, you must have a JMX implementation on your classpath.


[[jmx-mbean-server]]
== Reusing an Existing `MBeanServer`

If no server is specified, the `MBeanExporter` tries to automatically detect a running
`MBeanServer`. This works in most environments, where only one `MBeanServer` instance is
used. However, when multiple instances exist, the exporter might pick the wrong server.
In such cases, you should use the `MBeanServer` `agentId` to indicate which instance to
be used, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans>
  <bean id="mbeanServer" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.support.MBeanServerFactoryBean">
    <!-- indicate to first look for a server -->
    <property name="locateExistingServerIfPossible" value="true"/>
    <!-- search for the MBeanServer instance with the given agentId -->
    <property name="agentId" value="MBeanServer_instance_agentId>"/>
  </bean>
  <bean id="exporter" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.export.MBeanExporter">
    <property name="server" ref="mbeanServer"/>
    ...
  </bean>
</beans>
----

For platforms or cases where the existing `MBeanServer` has a dynamic (or unknown)
`agentId` that is retrieved through lookup methods, you should use
xref:core/beans/definition.adoc#beans-factory-class-static-factory-method[factory-method],
as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans>
  <bean id="exporter" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.export.MBeanExporter">
    <property name="server">
      <!-- Custom MBeanServerLocator -->
      <bean class="platform.package.MBeanServerLocator" factory-method="locateMBeanServer"/>
    </property>
  </bean>

  <!-- other beans here -->

</beans>
----


[[jmx-exporting-lazy]]
== Lazily Initialized MBeans

If you configure a bean with an `MBeanExporter` that is also configured for lazy
initialization, the `MBeanExporter` does not break this contract and avoids
instantiating the bean. Instead, it registers a proxy with the `MBeanServer` and defers
obtaining the bean from the container until the first invocation on the proxy occurs.

This also affects `FactoryBean` resolution where `MBeanExporter` will regularly
introspect the produced object, effectively triggering `FactoryBean.getObject()`.
In order to avoid this, mark the corresponding bean definition as lazy-init.


[[jmx-exporting-auto]]
== Automatic Registration of MBeans

Any beans that are exported through the `MBeanExporter` and are already valid MBeans
are registered as-is with the `MBeanServer` without further intervention from Infra.
You can cause MBeans to be automatically detected by the `MBeanExporter` by setting
the `autodetect` property to `true`, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="exporter" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.export.MBeanExporter">
  <property name="autodetect" value="true"/>
</bean>

<bean name="spring:mbean=true" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.export.TestDynamicMBean"/>
----

In the preceding example, the bean called `spring:mbean=true` is already a valid JMX MBean
and is automatically registered by Infra. By default, a bean that is autodetected for JMX
registration has its bean name used as the `ObjectName`. You can override this behavior,
as detailed in xref:integration/jmx/naming.adoc[Controlling  `ObjectName` Instances for Your Beans].


[[jmx-exporting-registration-behavior]]
== Controlling the Registration Behavior

Consider the scenario where a Infra `MBeanExporter` attempts to register an `MBean`
with an `MBeanServer` by using the `ObjectName` `bean:name=testBean1`. If an `MBean`
instance has already been registered under that same `ObjectName`, the default behavior
is to fail (and throw an `InstanceAlreadyExistsException`).

You can control exactly what happens when an `MBean` is
registered with an `MBeanServer`. Infra JMX support allows for three different
registration behaviors to control the registration behavior when the registration
process finds that an `MBean` has already been registered under the same `ObjectName`.
The following table summarizes these registration behaviors:

[[jmx-registration-behaviors]]
.Registration Behaviors
[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Registration behavior | Explanation

| `FAIL_ON_EXISTING`
| This is the default registration behavior. If an `MBean` instance has already been
  registered under the same `ObjectName`, the `MBean` that is being registered is not
  registered, and an `InstanceAlreadyExistsException` is thrown. The existing
  `MBean` is unaffected.

| `IGNORE_EXISTING`
| If an `MBean` instance has already been registered under the same `ObjectName`, the
  `MBean` that is being registered is not registered. The existing `MBean` is
  unaffected, and no `Exception` is thrown. This is useful in settings where
  multiple applications want to share a common `MBean` in a shared `MBeanServer`.

| `REPLACE_EXISTING`
| If an `MBean` instance has already been registered under the same `ObjectName`, the
  existing `MBean` that was previously registered is unregistered, and the new
  `MBean` is registered in its place (the new `MBean` effectively replaces the
  previous instance).
|===

The values in the preceding table are defined as enums on the `RegistrationPolicy` class.
If you want to change the default registration behavior, you need to set the value of the
`registrationPolicy` property on your `MBeanExporter` definition to one of those
values.

The following example shows how to change from the default registration
behavior to the `REPLACE_EXISTING` behavior:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans>

  <bean id="exporter" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.export.MBeanExporter">
    <property name="beans">
      <map>
        <entry key="bean:name=testBean1" value-ref="testBean"/>
      </map>
    </property>
    <property name="registrationPolicy" value="REPLACE_EXISTING"/>
  </bean>

  <bean id="testBean" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.JmxTestBean">
    <property name="name" value="TEST"/>
    <property name="age" value="100"/>
  </bean>

</beans>
