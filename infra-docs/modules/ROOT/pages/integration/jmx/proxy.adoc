= Accessing MBeans through Proxies

Spring JMX lets you create proxies that re-route calls to MBeans that are registered in a
local or remote `MBeanServer`. These proxies provide you with a standard Java interface,
through which you can interact with your MBeans. The following code shows how to configure a
proxy for an MBean running in a local `MBeanServer`:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="proxy" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.access.MBeanProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="objectName" value="bean:name=testBean"/>
  <property name="proxyInterface" value="cn.taketoday.jmx.IJmxTestBean"/>
</bean>
----

In the preceding example, you can see that a proxy is created for the MBean registered under the
`ObjectName` of `bean:name=testBean`. The set of interfaces that the proxy implements
is controlled by the `proxyInterfaces` property, and the rules for mapping methods and
properties on these interfaces to operations and attributes on the MBean are the same
rules used by the `InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler`.

The `MBeanProxyFactoryBean` can create a proxy to any MBean that is accessible through an
`MBeanServerConnection`. By default, the local `MBeanServer` is located and used, but
you can override this and provide an `MBeanServerConnection` that points to a remote
`MBeanServer` to cater for proxies that point to remote MBeans:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="clientConnector"
    class="cn.taketoday.jmx.support.MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean">
  <property name="serviceUrl" value="service:jmx:rmi://remotehost:9875"/>
</bean>

<bean id="proxy" class="cn.taketoday.jmx.access.MBeanProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="objectName" value="bean:name=testBean"/>
  <property name="proxyInterface" value="cn.taketoday.jmx.IJmxTestBean"/>
  <property name="server" ref="clientConnector"/>
</bean>
----

In the preceding example, we create an `MBeanServerConnection` that points to a remote machine
that uses the `MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean`. This `MBeanServerConnection` is then
passed to the `MBeanProxyFactoryBean` through the `server` property. The proxy that is
created forwards all invocations to the `MBeanServer` through this
`MBeanServerConnection`.
