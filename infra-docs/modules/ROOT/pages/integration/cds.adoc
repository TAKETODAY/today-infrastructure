Class Data Sharing (CDS) is a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/vm/class-data-sharing.html[JVM feature]
that can help reduce the startup time and memory footprint of Java applications.

To use this feature, a CDS archive should be created for the particular classpath of the
application. The Spring Framework provides a hook-point to ease the creation of the
archive. Once the archive is available, users should opt in to use it via a JVM flag.

== Creating the CDS Archive

A CDS archive for an application can be created when the application exits. The Spring
Framework provides a mode of operation where the process can exit automatically once the
`ApplicationContext` has refreshed. In this mode, all non-lazy initialized singletons
have been instantiated, and `InitializingBean#afterPropertiesSet` callbacks have been
invoked; but the lifecycle has not started, and the `ContextRefreshedEvent` has not yet
been published.

To create the archive, two additional JVM flags must be specified:

* `-XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit=application.jsa`: creates the CDS archive on exit
* `-Dspring.context.exit=onRefresh`: starts and then immediately exits your Spring
  application as described above

To create a CDS archive, your JDK must have a base image. If you add the flags above to
your startup script, you may get a warning that looks like this:

[source,shell,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
  -XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit is unsupported when base CDS archive is not loaded. Run with -Xlog:cds for more info.
----

The base CDS archive can be created by issuing the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
  $ java -Xshare:dump
----

== Using the Archive

Once the archive is available, add `-XX:SharedArchiveFile=application.jsa` to your startup
script to use it, assuming an `application.jsa` file in the working directory.

To figure out how effective the cache is, you can enable class loading logs by adding
an extra attribute: `-Xlog:class+load:file=cds.log`. This creates a `cds.log` with every
attempt to load a class and its source. Classes that are loaded from the cache should have
a "shared objects file" source, as shown in the following example:

[source,shell,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
  [0.064s][info][class,load] cn.taketoday.core.env.EnvironmentCapable source: shared objects file (top)
  [0.064s][info][class,load] cn.taketoday.beans.factory.BeanFactory source: shared objects file (top)
  [0.064s][info][class,load] cn.taketoday.beans.factory.ListableBeanFactory source: shared objects file (top)
  [0.064s][info][class,load] cn.taketoday.beans.factory.HierarchicalBeanFactory source: shared objects file (top)
  [0.065s][info][class,load] cn.taketoday.context.MessageSource source: shared objects file (top)
----

TIP: If you have a large number of classes that are not loaded from the cache, make sure that
the JDK and classpath used by the commands that create the archive and start the application
are identical. Note also that to effectively cache classes, the classpath should be specified
as a list of JARs containing those classes, and avoid the usage of directories and `*`
wildcard characters.
