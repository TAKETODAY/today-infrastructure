= Standard Annotation Support

The following annotations are supported with standard semantics for all configurations of
the Infra TestContext Framework. Note that these annotations are not specific to tests
and can be used anywhere in the TODAY Framework.

* `@Autowired`
* `@Qualifier`
* `@Value`
* `@Resource` (jakarta.annotation) if JSR-250 is present
* `@ManagedBean` (jakarta.annotation) if JSR-250 is present
* `@Inject` (jakarta.inject) if JSR-330 is present
* `@Named` (jakarta.inject) if JSR-330 is present
* `@PersistenceContext` (jakarta.persistence) if JPA is present
* `@PersistenceUnit` (jakarta.persistence) if JPA is present
* `@Transactional` (cn.taketoday.transaction.annotation)

.JSR-250 Lifecycle Annotations
[NOTE]
====
In the Infra TestContext Framework, you can use `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` with
standard semantics on any application components configured in the `ApplicationContext`.
However, these lifecycle annotations have limited usage within an actual test class.

If a method within a test class is annotated with `@PostConstruct`, that method runs
before any before methods of the underlying test framework (for example, methods
annotated with JUnit Jupiter's `@BeforeEach`), and that applies for every test method in
the test class. On the other hand, if a method within a test class is annotated with
`@PreDestroy`, that method never runs. Therefore, within a test class, we recommend that
you use test lifecycle callbacks from the underlying test framework instead of
`@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`.
