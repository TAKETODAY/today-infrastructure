= `@DirtiesContext`

`@DirtiesContext` indicates that the underlying Infra `ApplicationContext` has been
dirtied during the execution of a test (that is, the test modified or corrupted it in
some manner -- for example, by changing the state of a singleton bean) and should be
closed. When an application context is marked as dirty, it is removed from the testing
framework's cache and closed. As a consequence, the underlying Infra container is
rebuilt for any subsequent test that requires a context with the same configuration
metadata.

You can use `@DirtiesContext` as both a class-level and a method-level annotation within
the same class or class hierarchy. In such scenarios, the `ApplicationContext` is marked
as dirty before or after any such annotated method as well as before or after the current
test class, depending on the configured `methodMode` and `classMode`. When
`@DirtiesContext` is declared at both the class level and the method level, the
configured modes from both annotations will be honored. For example, if the class mode is
set to `BEFORE_EACH_TEST_METHOD` and the method mode is set to `AFTER_METHOD`, the
context will be marked as dirty both before and after the given test method.

The following examples explain when the context would be dirtied for various
configuration scenarios:

* Before the current test class, when declared on a class with class mode set to
`BEFORE_CLASS`.

If you use `@DirtiesContext` in a test whose context is configured as part of a context
hierarchy with `@ContextHierarchy`, you can use the `hierarchyMode` flag to control how
the context cache is cleared. By default, an exhaustive algorithm is used to clear the
context cache, including not only the current level but also all other context
hierarchies that share an ancestor context common to the current test. All
`ApplicationContext` instances that reside in a sub-hierarchy of the common ancestor
context are removed from the context cache and closed. If the exhaustive algorithm is
overkill for a particular use case, you can specify the simpler current level algorithm,
as the following example shows.

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@ContextHierarchy({
  @ContextConfiguration("/parent-config.xml"),
  @ContextConfiguration("/child-config.xml")
})
class BaseTests {
  // class body...
}

class ExtendedTests extends BaseTests {

  @Test
  @DirtiesContext(hierarchyMode = CURRENT_LEVEL) // <1>
  void test() {
    // some logic that results in the child context being dirtied
  }
}
----
<1> Use the current-level algorithm.
