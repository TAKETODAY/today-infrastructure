`@RecordApplicationEvents` is a class-level annotation that is used to instruct the
_Infra TestContext Framework_ to record all application events that are published in the
`ApplicationContext` during the execution of a single test.

The recorded events can be accessed via the `ApplicationEvents` API within tests.

See xref:testing/testcontext-framework/application-events.adoc[Application Events] and the 
{today-framework-api}/test/context/event/RecordApplicationEvents.html[`@RecordApplicationEvents`
javadoc] for an example and further details.
