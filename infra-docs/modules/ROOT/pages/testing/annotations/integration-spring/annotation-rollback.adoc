= `@Rollback`

`@Rollback` indicates whether the transaction for a transactional test method should be
rolled back after the test method has completed. If `true`, the transaction is rolled
back. Otherwise, the transaction is committed (see also
xref:testing/annotations/integration-spring/annotation-commit.adoc[`@Commit`]). Rollback for integration tests in the Infra
TestContext Framework defaults to `true` even if `@Rollback` is not explicitly declared.

When declared as a class-level annotation, `@Rollback` defines the default rollback
semantics for all test methods within the test class hierarchy. When declared as a
method-level annotation, `@Rollback` defines rollback semantics for the specific test
method, potentially overriding class-level `@Rollback` or `@Commit` semantics.

The following example causes a test method's result to not be rolled back (that is, the
result is committed to the database):
