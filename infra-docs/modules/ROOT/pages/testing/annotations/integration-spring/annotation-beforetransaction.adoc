= `@BeforeTransaction`

`@BeforeTransaction` indicates that the annotated `void` method should be run before a
transaction is started, for test methods that have been configured to run within a
transaction by using Infra `@Transactional` annotation. `@BeforeTransaction` methods
are not required to be `public` and may be declared on Java 8-based interface default
methods.

The following example shows how to use the `@BeforeTransaction` annotation:

Java::

void beforeTransaction() {
  // logic to be run before a transaction is started
}
----
<1> Run this method before a transaction.
