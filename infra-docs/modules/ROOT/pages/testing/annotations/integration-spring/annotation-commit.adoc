= `@Commit`

`@Commit` indicates that the transaction for a transactional test method should be
committed after the test method has completed. You can use `@Commit` as a direct
replacement for `@Rollback(false)` to more explicitly convey the intent of the code.
Analogous to `@Rollback`, `@Commit` can also be declared as a class-level or method-level
annotation.

The following example shows how to use the `@Commit` annotation:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Commit // <1>
@Test
void testProcessWithoutRollback() {
  // ...
}
----
<1> Commit the result of the test to the database.
