= `@ActiveProfiles`

`@ActiveProfiles` is a class-level annotation that is used to declare which bean
definition profiles should be active when loading an `ApplicationContext` for an
integration test.

The following example indicates that the `dev` profile should be active:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@ContextConfiguration
@ActiveProfiles("dev") // <1>
class DeveloperTests {
  // class body...
}
----
<1> Indicate that the `dev` profile should be active.

======


The following example indicates that both the `dev` and the `integration` profiles should
be active:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@ContextConfiguration
@ActiveProfiles({"dev", "integration"}) // <1>
class DeveloperIntegrationTests {
  // class body...
}
----
<1> Indicate that the `dev` and `integration` profiles should be active.

======


NOTE: `@ActiveProfiles` provides support for inheriting active bean definition profiles
declared by superclasses and enclosing classes by default. You can also resolve active
bean definition profiles programmatically by implementing a custom
xref:testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/env-profiles.adoc#testcontext-ctx-management-env-profiles-ActiveProfilesResolver[`ActiveProfilesResolver`]
and registering it by using the `resolver` attribute of `@ActiveProfiles`.

See xref:testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/env-profiles.adoc[Context Configuration with Environment Profiles],
xref:testing/testcontext-framework/support-classes.adoc#testcontext-junit-jupiter-nested-test-configuration[`@Nested` test class configuration], and the
{today-framework-api}/test/context/ActiveProfiles.html[`@ActiveProfiles`] javadoc for
examples and further details.
