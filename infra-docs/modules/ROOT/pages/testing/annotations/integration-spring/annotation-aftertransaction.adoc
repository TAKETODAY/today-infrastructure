`@AfterTransaction` indicates that the annotated `void` method should be run after a
transaction is ended, for test methods that have been configured to run within a
transaction by using Spring's `@Transactional` annotation. `@AfterTransaction` methods
are not required to be `public` and may be declared on Java 8-based interface default
methods.
