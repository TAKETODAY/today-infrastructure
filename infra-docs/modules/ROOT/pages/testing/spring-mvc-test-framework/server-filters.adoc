= Filter Registrations
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

When setting up a `MockMvc` instance, you can register one or more Servlet `Filter`
instances, as the following example shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	mockMvc = standaloneSetup(new PersonController()).addFilters(new CharacterEncodingFilter()).build();
----

Registered filters are invoked through the `MockFilterChain` from `today-test`, and the
last filter delegates to the `MockDispatcher`.
