When using MockMvc directly to perform requests, you'll need static imports for:

- `MockMvcBuilders.{asterisk}`
- `MockMvcRequestBuilders.{asterisk}`
- `MockMvcResultMatchers.{asterisk}`
- `MockMvcResultHandlers.{asterisk}`

An easy way to remember that is search for `MockMvc*`. If using Eclipse be sure to also
add the above as "`favorite static members`" in the Eclipse preferences.

When using MockMvc through the xref:testing/webtestclient.adoc[WebTestClient] you do not need static imports.
The `WebTestClient` provides a fluent API without static imports.
