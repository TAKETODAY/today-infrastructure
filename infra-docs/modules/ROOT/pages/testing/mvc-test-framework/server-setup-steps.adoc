= Setup Features

No matter which MockMvc builder you use, all `MockMvcBuilder` implementations provide
some common and very useful features. For example, you can declare an `Accept` header for
all requests and expect a status of 200 as well as a `Content-Type` header in all
responses, as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
// static import of MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup

MockMvc mockMvc = standaloneSetup(new MusicController())
  .defaultRequest(get("/").accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
  .alwaysExpect(status().isOk())
  .alwaysExpect(content().contentType("application/json;charset=UTF-8"))
  .build();
----

In addition, third-party frameworks (and applications) can pre-package setup
instructions, such as those in a `MockMvcConfigurer`. The TODAY Framework has one such
built-in implementation that helps to save and re-use the HTTP session across requests.
You can use it as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	// static import of SharedHttpSessionConfigurer.sharedHttpSession

	MockMvc mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup(new TestController())
			.apply(sharedHttpSession())
			.build();

	// Use mockMvc to perform requests...
----

See the javadoc for
{today-framework-api}/test/web/mockApi/setup/ConfigurableMockMvcBuilder.html[`ConfigurableMockMvcBuilder`]
for a list of all MockMvc builder features or use the IDE to explore the available options.
