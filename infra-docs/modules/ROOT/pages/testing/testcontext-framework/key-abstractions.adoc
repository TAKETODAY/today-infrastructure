[[testcontext-key-abstractions]]
= Key Abstractions

The core of the framework consists of the `TestContextManager` class and the
`TestContext`, `TestExecutionListener`, and `SmartContextLoader` interfaces. A
`TestContextManager` is created for each test class (for example, for the execution of
all test methods within a single test class in JUnit Jupiter). The `TestContextManager`,
in turn, manages a `TestContext` that holds the context of the current test. The
`TestContextManager` also updates the state of the `TestContext` as the test progresses
and delegates to `TestExecutionListener` implementations, which instrument the actual
test execution by providing dependency injection, managing transactions, and so on. A
`SmartContextLoader` is responsible for loading an `ApplicationContext` for a given test
class. See the {today-framework-api}/test/context/package-summary.html[javadoc] and the
Infra test suite for further information and examples of various implementations.

[[testcontext]]
== `TestContext`

`TestContext` encapsulates the context in which a test is run (agnostic of the
actual testing framework in use) and provides context management and caching support for
the test instance for which it is responsible. The `TestContext` also delegates to a
`SmartContextLoader` to load an `ApplicationContext` if requested.

[[testcontextmanager]]
== `TestContextManager`

`TestContextManager` is the main entry point into the Infra TestContext Framework and is
responsible for managing a single `TestContext` and signaling events to each registered
`TestExecutionListener` at well-defined test execution points:

* Prior to any "`before class`" or "`before all`" methods of a particular testing framework.
* Test instance post-processing.
* Prior to any "`before`" or "`before each`" methods of a particular testing framework.
* Immediately before execution of the test method but after test setup.
* Immediately after execution of the test method but before test tear down.
* After any "`after`" or "`after each`" methods of a particular testing framework.
* After any "`after class`" or "`after all`" methods of a particular testing framework.

[[testexecutionlistener]]
== `TestExecutionListener`

`TestExecutionListener` defines the API for reacting to test-execution events published by
the `TestContextManager` with which the listener is registered. See xref:testing/testcontext-framework/tel-config.adoc[`TestExecutionListener` Configuration].

[[context-loaders]]
== Context Loaders

`ContextLoader` is a strategy interface for loading an `ApplicationContext` for an
integration test managed by the Infra TestContext Framework. You should implement
`SmartContextLoader` instead of this interface to provide support for component classes,
active bean definition profiles, test property sources, context hierarchies, and
`WebApplicationContext` support.

`SmartContextLoader` is an extension of the `ContextLoader` interface that supersedes the
original minimal `ContextLoader` SPI. Specifically, a `SmartContextLoader` can choose to
process resource locations, component classes, or context initializers. Furthermore, a
`SmartContextLoader` can set active bean definition profiles and test property sources in
the context that it loads.

Infra provides the following implementations:

* `DelegatingSmartContextLoader`: One of two default loaders, it delegates internally to
  an `AnnotationConfigContextLoader`, a `GenericXmlContextLoader`, or a
  `GenericGroovyXmlContextLoader`, depending either on the configuration declared for the
  test class or on the presence of default locations or default configuration classes.
  Groovy support is enabled only if Groovy is on the classpath.
* `WebDelegatingSmartContextLoader`: One of two default loaders, it delegates internally
  to an `AnnotationConfigWebContextLoader`, a `GenericXmlWebContextLoader`, or a
  `GenericGroovyXmlWebContextLoader`, depending either on the configuration declared for
  the test class or on the presence of default locations or default configuration
  classes. A web `ContextLoader` is used only if `@WebAppConfiguration` is present on the
  test class. Groovy support is enabled only if Groovy is on the classpath.
* `AnnotationConfigContextLoader`: Loads a standard `ApplicationContext` from component
  classes.
* `AnnotationConfigWebContextLoader`: Loads a `WebApplicationContext` from component
  classes.
* `GenericGroovyXmlContextLoader`: Loads a standard `ApplicationContext` from resource
  locations that are either Groovy scripts or XML configuration files.
* `GenericGroovyXmlWebContextLoader`: Loads a `WebApplicationContext` from resource
  locations that are either Groovy scripts or XML configuration files.
* `GenericXmlContextLoader`: Loads a standard `ApplicationContext` from XML resource
  locations.
* `GenericXmlWebContextLoader`: Loads a `WebApplicationContext` from XML resource
  locations.
