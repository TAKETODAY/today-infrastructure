= Testing Request- and Session-scoped Beans

Spring has supported xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc#beans-factory-scopes-other[Request- and session-scoped beans]
 since the early years, and you can test your request-scoped and session-scoped
beans by following these steps:

* Ensure that a `WebApplicationContext` is loaded for your test by annotating your test
  class with `@WebAppConfiguration`.
* Inject the mock request or session into your test instance and prepare your test
  fixture as appropriate.
* Invoke your web component that you retrieved from the configured
  `WebApplicationContext` (with dependency injection).
* Perform assertions against the mocks.

The next code snippet shows the XML configuration for a login use case. Note that the
`userService` bean has a dependency on a request-scoped `loginAction` bean. Also, the
`LoginAction` is instantiated by using xref:core/expressions.adoc[SpEL expressions] that
retrieve the username and password from the current HTTP request. In our test, we want to
configure these request parameters through the mock managed by the TestContext framework.
The following listing shows the configuration for this use case:

.Request-scoped bean configuration
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<beans>

  <bean id="userService" class="com.example.SimpleUserService"
      c:loginAction-ref="loginAction"/>

  <bean id="loginAction" class="com.example.LoginAction"
      c:username="#{request.getParameter('user')}"
      c:password="#{request.getParameter('pswd')}"
      scope="request">
    <aop:scoped-proxy/>
  </bean>

</beans>
----

In `RequestScopedBeanTests`, we inject both the `UserService` (that is, the subject under
test) and the `MockHttpServletRequest` into our test instance. Within our
`requestScope()` test method, we set up our test fixture by setting request parameters in
the provided `MockHttpServletRequest`. When the `loginUser()` method is invoked on our
`userService`, we are assured that the user service has access to the request-scoped
`loginAction` for the current `MockHttpServletRequest` (that is, the one in which we just
set parameters). We can then perform assertions against the results based on the known
inputs for the username and password. The following listing shows how to do so:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@SpringJUnitWebConfig
class RequestScopedBeanTests {

  @Autowired UserService userService;
  @Autowired MockHttpServletRequest request;

  @Test
  void requestScope() {
    request.setParameter("user", "enigma");
    request.setParameter("pswd", "$pr!ng");

    LoginResults results = userService.loginUser();
    // assert results
  }
}
----

The following code snippet is similar to the one we saw earlier for a request-scoped
bean. However, this time, the `userService` bean has a dependency on a session-scoped
`userPreferences` bean. Note that the `UserPreferences` bean is instantiated by using a
SpEL expression that retrieves the theme from the current HTTP session. In our test, we
need to configure a theme in the mock session managed by the TestContext framework. The
following example shows how to do so:

.Session-scoped bean configuration
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans>

  <bean id="userService" class="com.example.SimpleUserService"
      c:userPreferences-ref="userPreferences" />

  <bean id="userPreferences" class="com.example.UserPreferences"
      c:theme="#{session.getAttribute('theme')}"
      scope="session">
    <aop:scoped-proxy/>
  </bean>

</beans>
----

In `SessionScopedBeanTests`, we inject the `UserService` and the `MockHttpSession` into
our test instance. Within our `sessionScope()` test method, we set up our test fixture by
setting the expected `theme` attribute in the provided `MockHttpSession`. When the
`processUserPreferences()` method is invoked on our `userService`, we are assured that
the user service has access to the session-scoped `userPreferences` for the current
`MockHttpSession`, and we can perform assertions against the results based on the
configured theme. The following example shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Session-scoped bean test::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@SpringJUnitWebConfig
class SessionScopedBeanTests {

  @Autowired UserService userService;
  @Autowired MockHttpSession session;

  @Test
  void sessionScope() throws Exception {
    session.setAttribute("theme", "blue");

    Results results = userService.processUserPreferences();
    // assert results
  }
}
