= Test Execution Events

The `EventPublishingTestExecutionListener` introduced in Spring Framework 5.2 offers an
alternative approach to implementing a custom `TestExecutionListener`. Components in the
test's `ApplicationContext` can listen to the following events published by the
`EventPublishingTestExecutionListener`, each of which corresponds to a method in the
`TestExecutionListener` API.

* `BeforeTestClassEvent`
* `PrepareTestInstanceEvent`
* `BeforeTestMethodEvent`
* `BeforeTestExecutionEvent`
* `AfterTestExecutionEvent`
* `AfterTestMethodEvent`
* `AfterTestClassEvent`

These events may be consumed for various reasons, such as resetting mock beans or tracing
test execution. One advantage of consuming test execution events rather than implementing
a custom `TestExecutionListener` is that test execution events may be consumed by any
Spring bean registered in the test `ApplicationContext`, and such beans may benefit
directly from dependency injection and other features of the `ApplicationContext`. In
contrast, a `TestExecutionListener` is not a bean in the `ApplicationContext`.

[NOTE]
====
The `EventPublishingTestExecutionListener` is registered by default; however, it only
publishes events if the `ApplicationContext` has _already been loaded_. This prevents the
`ApplicationContext` from being loaded unnecessarily or too early.

Consequently, a `BeforeTestClassEvent` will not be published until after the
`ApplicationContext` has been loaded by another `TestExecutionListener`. For example, with
the default set of `TestExecutionListener` implementations registered, a
`BeforeTestClassEvent` will not be published for the first test class that uses a
particular test `ApplicationContext`, but a `BeforeTestClassEvent` _will_ be published for
any subsequent test class in the same test suite that uses the same test
`ApplicationContext` since the context will already have been loaded when subsequent test
classes run (as long as the context has not been removed from the `ContextCache` via
`@DirtiesContext` or the max-size eviction policy).

If you wish to ensure that a `BeforeTestClassEvent` is always published for every test
class, you need to register a `TestExecutionListener` that loads the `ApplicationContext`
in the `beforeTestClass` callback, and that `TestExecutionListener` must be registered
_before_ the `EventPublishingTestExecutionListener`.

Similarly, if `@DirtiesContext` is used to remove the `ApplicationContext` from the
context cache after the last test method in a given test class, the `AfterTestClassEvent`
will not be published for that test class.

In order to listen to test execution events, a Spring bean may choose to implement the
`cn.taketoday.context.ApplicationListener` interface. Alternatively, listener
methods can be annotated with `@EventListener` and configured to listen to one of the
particular event types listed above (see
xref:core/beans/context-introduction.adoc#context-functionality-events-annotation[Annotation-based Event Listeners]).
Due to the popularity of this approach, Spring provides the following dedicated
`@EventListener` annotations to simplify registration of test execution event listeners.
These annotations reside in the `cn.taketoday.test.context.event.annotation`
package.

* `@BeforeTestClass`
* `@PrepareTestInstance`
* `@BeforeTestMethod`
* `@BeforeTestExecution`
* `@AfterTestExecution`
* `@AfterTestMethod`
* `@AfterTestClass`

[[testcontext-test-execution-events-exception-handling]]
== Exception Handling

By default, if a test execution event listener throws an exception while consuming an
event, that exception will propagate to the underlying testing framework in use (such as
JUnit or TestNG). For example, if the consumption of a `BeforeTestMethodEvent` results in
an exception, the corresponding test method will fail as a result of the exception. In
contrast, if an asynchronous test execution event listener throws an exception, the
exception will not propagate to the underlying testing framework. For further details on
asynchronous exception handling, consult the class-level javadoc for `@EventListener`.

[[testcontext-test-execution-events-async]]
== Asynchronous Listeners

If you want a particular test execution event listener to process events asynchronously,
you can use Spring's xref:integration/scheduling.adoc#scheduling-annotation-support-async[regular `@Async` support]
. For further details, consult the class-level javadoc for
`@EventListener`.
