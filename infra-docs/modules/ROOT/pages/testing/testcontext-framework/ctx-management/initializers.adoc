= Context Configuration with Context Initializers

To configure an `ApplicationContext` for your tests by using context initializers,
annotate your test class with `@ContextConfiguration` and configure the `initializers`
attribute with an array that contains references to classes that implement
`ApplicationContextInitializer`. The declared context initializers are then used to
initialize the `ConfigurableApplicationContext` that is loaded for your tests. Note that
the concrete `ConfigurableApplicationContext` type supported by each declared initializer
must be compatible with the type of `ApplicationContext` created by the
`SmartContextLoader` in use (typically a `GenericApplicationContext`). Furthermore, the
order in which the initializers are invoked depends on whether they implement Spring's
`Ordered` interface or are annotated with Spring's `@Order` annotation or the standard
`@Priority` annotation. The following example shows how to use initializers:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
// ApplicationContext will be loaded from TestConfig
// and initialized by TestAppCtxInitializer
@ContextConfiguration(
  classes = TestConfig.class,
  initializers = TestAppCtxInitializer.class) // <1>
class MyTest {
  // class body...
}
----

<1> Specifying configuration by using a configuration class and an initializer.

You can also omit the declaration of XML configuration files, Groovy scripts, or
component classes in `@ContextConfiguration` entirely and instead declare only
`ApplicationContextInitializer` classes, which are then responsible for registering beans
in the context -- for example, by programmatically loading bean definitions from XML
files or configuration classes. The following example shows how to do so:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
// ApplicationContext will be initialized by EntireAppInitializer
// which presumably registers beans in the context
@ContextConfiguration(initializers = EntireAppInitializer.class) <1>
class MyTest {
  // class body...
}
----

<1> Specifying configuration by using only an initializer.
