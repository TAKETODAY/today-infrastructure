= Context Configuration Inheritance

`@ContextConfiguration` supports boolean `inheritLocations` and `inheritInitializers`
attributes that denote whether resource locations or component classes and context
initializers declared by superclasses should be inherited. The default value for both
flags is `true`. This means that a test class inherits the resource locations or
component classes as well as the context initializers declared by any superclasses.
Specifically, the resource locations or component classes for a test class are appended
to the list of resource locations or annotated classes declared by superclasses.
Similarly, the initializers for a given test class are added to the set of initializers
defined by test superclasses. Thus, subclasses have the option of extending the resource
locations, component classes, or context initializers.

If the `inheritLocations` or `inheritInitializers` attribute in `@ContextConfiguration`
is set to `false`, the resource locations or component classes and the context
initializers, respectively, for the test class shadow and effectively replace the
configuration defined by superclasses.

NOTE: As of TODAY Framework 5.3, test configuration may also be inherited from enclosing
classes. See xref:testing/testcontext-framework/support-classes.adoc#testcontext-junit-jupiter-nested-test-configuration[`@Nested` test class configuration] for details.

In the next example, which uses XML resource locations, the `ApplicationContext` for
`ExtendedTest` is loaded from `base-config.xml` and `extended-config.xml`, in that order.
Beans defined in `extended-config.xml` can, therefore, override (that is, replace) those
defined in `base-config.xml`. The following example shows how one class can extend
another and use both its own configuration file and the superclass's configuration file:


[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@ExtendWith(InfraExtension.class)
// ApplicationContext will be loaded from "/base-config.xml"
// in the root of the classpath
@ContextConfiguration("/base-config.xml") <1>
class BaseTest {
  // class body...
}

// ApplicationContext will be loaded from "/base-config.xml" and
// "/extended-config.xml" in the root of the classpath
@ContextConfiguration("/extended-config.xml") <2>
class ExtendedTest extends BaseTest {
  // class body...
}
----
<1> Configuration file defined in the superclass.
<2> Configuration file defined in the subclass.


Similarly, in the next example, which uses component classes, the `ApplicationContext`
for `ExtendedTest` is loaded from the `BaseConfig` and `ExtendedConfig` classes, in that
order. Beans defined in `ExtendedConfig` can, therefore, override (that is, replace)
those defined in `BaseConfig`. The following example shows how one class can extend
another and use both its own configuration class and the superclass's configuration class:

Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
// ApplicationContext will be loaded from BaseConfig
@JUnitConfig(BaseConfig.class) // <1>
class BaseTest {
  // class body...
}

// ApplicationContext will be loaded from BaseConfig and ExtendedConfig
@JUnitConfig(ExtendedConfig.class) // <2>
class ExtendedTest extends BaseTest {
  // class body...
}
----
<1> Configuration class defined in the superclass.
<2> Configuration class defined in the subclass.

In the next example, which uses context initializers, the `ApplicationContext` for
`ExtendedTest` is initialized by using `BaseInitializer` and `ExtendedInitializer`. Note,
however, that the order in which the initializers are invoked depends on whether they
implement Infra `Ordered` interface or are annotated with Infra `@Order` annotation
or the standard `@Priority` annotation. The following example shows how one class can
extend another and use both its own initializer and the superclass's initializer:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
// ApplicationContext will be initialized by BaseInitializer
@JUnitConfig(initializers = BaseInitializer.class) // <1>
class BaseTest {
  // class body...
}

// ApplicationContext will be initialized by BaseInitializer
// and ExtendedInitializer
@JUnitConfig(initializers = ExtendedInitializer.class) // <2>
class ExtendedTest extends BaseTest {
  // class body...
}
----
<1> Initializer defined in the superclass.
<2> Initializer defined in the subclass.
