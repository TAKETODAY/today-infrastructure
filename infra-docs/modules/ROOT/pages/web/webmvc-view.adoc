= View Technologies
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

The use of view technologies in Web MVC is pluggable. Whether you decide to use
Thymeleaf, Groovy Markup Templates, JSPs, or other technologies is primarily a matter of
a configuration change. This chapter covers view technologies integrated with Web MVC.
We assume you are already familiar with xref:web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/viewresolver.adoc[View Resolution].

WARNING: The views of a Web MVC application live within the internal trust boundaries
of that application. Views have access to all the beans of your application context. As
such, it is not recommended to use Web MVC's template support in applications where
the templates are editable by external sources, since this can have security implications.
