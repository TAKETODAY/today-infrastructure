The MVC Java configuration and the MVC XML namespace provide default configuration
suitable for most applications and a configuration API to customize it.

For more advanced customizations, which are not available in the configuration API,
see xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config/advanced-java.adoc[Advanced Java Config] and xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config/advanced-xml.adoc[Advanced XML Config].

You do not need to understand the underlying beans created by the MVC Java configuration
and the MVC namespace. If you want to learn more, see xref:web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/special-bean-types.adoc[Special Bean Types]
and xref:web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/config.adoc[Web MVC Config].
