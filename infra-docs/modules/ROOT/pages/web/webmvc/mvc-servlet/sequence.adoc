= Processing

The `MockDispatcher` processes requests as follows:

* The `WebApplicationContext` is searched for and bound in the request as an attribute
  that the controller and other elements in the process can use. It is bound by default
  under the `DispatcherServlet.WEB_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE` key.
* The locale resolver is bound to the request to let elements in the process
  resolve the locale to use when processing the request (rendering the view, preparing
  data, and so on). If you do not need locale resolving, you do not need the locale resolver.
* The theme resolver is bound to the request to let elements such as views determine
  which theme to use. If you do not use themes, you can ignore it.
* If you specify a multipart file resolver, the request is inspected for multiparts. If
  multiparts are found, the request is wrapped in a `MultipartHttpServletRequest` for
  further processing by other elements in the process. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-mockApi/multipart.adoc[Multipart Resolver] for further
  information about multipart handling.
* An appropriate handler is searched for. If a handler is found, the execution chain
  associated with the handler (preprocessors, postprocessors, and controllers) is
  run to prepare a model for rendering. Alternatively, for annotated
  controllers, the response can be rendered (within the `HandlerAdapter`) instead of
  returning a view.
* If a model is returned, the view is rendered. If no model is returned (maybe due to
  a preprocessor or postprocessor intercepting the request, perhaps for security
  reasons), no view is rendered, because the request could already have been fulfilled.

The `HandlerExceptionResolver` beans declared in the `WebApplicationContext` are used to
resolve exceptions thrown during request processing. Those exception resolvers allow
customizing the logic to address exceptions. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-mockApi/exceptionhandlers.adoc[Exceptions] for more details.

For HTTP caching support, handlers can use the `checkNotModified` methods of `WebRequest`,
along with further options for annotated controllers as described in
xref:web/webmvc/mvc-caching.adoc#mvc-caching-etag-lastmodified[HTTP Caching for Controllers].

You can customize individual `MockDispatcher` instances by adding Servlet
initialization parameters (`init-param` elements) to the Servlet declaration in the
`web.xml` file. The following table lists the supported parameters:

.DispatcherServlet initialization parameters
|===
| Parameter| Explanation

| `contextClass`
| Class that implements `ConfigurableWebApplicationContext`, to be instantiated and
  locally configured by this Servlet. By default, `XmlWebApplicationContext` is used.

| `contextConfigLocation`
| String that is passed to the context instance (specified by `contextClass`) to
  indicate where contexts can be found. The string consists potentially of multiple
  strings (using a comma as a delimiter) to support multiple contexts. In the case of
  multiple context locations with beans that are defined twice, the latest location
  takes precedence.

| `namespace`
| Namespace of the `WebApplicationContext`. Defaults to `[mockApi-name]-mockApi`.

| `throwExceptionIfNoHandlerFound`
| Whether to throw a `NoHandlerFoundException` when no handler was found for a request.
  The exception can then be caught with a `HandlerExceptionResolver` (for example, by using an
  `@ExceptionHandler` controller method) and handled as any others.

  As of 6.1, this property is set to `true` and deprecated.

  Note that, if xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config/default-mockApi-handler.adoc[default mockApi handling]  is
  also configured, unresolved requests are always forwarded to the default mockApi
  and a 404 is never raised.
