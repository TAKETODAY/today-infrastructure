= Themes

You can apply Spring Web MVC framework themes to set the overall look-and-feel of your
application, thereby enhancing user experience. A theme is a collection of static
resources, typically style sheets and images, that affect the visual style of the
application.

WARNING: as of 6.0 support for themes has been deprecated theme in favor of using CSS,
and without any special support on the server side.


[[mvc-themeresolver-defining]]
== Defining a theme

To use themes in your web application, you must set up an implementation of the
`cn.taketoday.ui.context.ThemeSource` interface. The `WebApplicationContext`
interface extends `ThemeSource` but delegates its responsibilities to a dedicated
implementation. By default, the delegate is an
`cn.taketoday.ui.context.support.ResourceBundleThemeSource` implementation that
loads properties files from the root of the classpath. To use a custom `ThemeSource`
implementation or to configure the base name prefix of the `ResourceBundleThemeSource`,
you can register a bean in the application context with the reserved name, `themeSource`.
The web application context automatically detects a bean with that name and uses it.

When you use the `ResourceBundleThemeSource`, a theme is defined in a simple properties
file. The properties file lists the resources that make up the theme, as the following example shows:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
styleSheet=/themes/cool/style.css
background=/themes/cool/img/coolBg.jpg
----

The keys of the properties are the names that refer to the themed elements from view
code. For a JSP, you typically do this using the `spring:theme` custom tag, which is
very similar to the `spring:message` tag. The following JSP fragment uses the theme
defined in the previous example to customize the look and feel:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<%@ taglib prefix="spring" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags"%>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="<spring:theme code='styleSheet'/>" type="text/css"/>
  </head>
  <body style="background=<spring:theme code='background'/>">
    ...
  </body>
</html>
----

By default, the `ResourceBundleThemeSource` uses an empty base name prefix. As a result,
the properties files are loaded from the root of the classpath. Thus, you would put the
`cool.properties` theme definition in a directory at the root of the classpath (for
example, in `/WEB-INF/classes`). The `ResourceBundleThemeSource` uses the standard Java
resource bundle loading mechanism, allowing for full internationalization of themes. For
example, we could have a `/WEB-INF/classes/cool_nl.properties` that references a special
background image with Dutch text on it.


[[mvc-themeresolver-resolving]]
== Resolving Themes

After you define themes, as described in the xref:web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/themeresolver.adoc#mvc-themeresolver-defining[preceding section],
you decide which theme to use. The `DispatcherServlet` looks for a bean named `themeResolver`
to find out which `ThemeResolver` implementation to use. A theme resolver works in much the same
way as a `LocaleResolver`. It detects the theme to use for a particular request and can also
alter the request's theme. The following table describes the theme resolvers provided by Spring:

[[mvc-theme-resolver-impls-tbl]]
.ThemeResolver implementations
[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Class | Description

| `FixedThemeResolver`
| Selects a fixed theme, set by using the `defaultThemeName` property.

| `SessionThemeResolver`
| The theme is maintained in the user's HTTP session. It needs to be set only once for
  each session but is not persisted between sessions.

| `CookieThemeResolver`
| The selected theme is stored in a cookie on the client.
|===

Spring also provides a `ThemeChangeInterceptor` that lets theme changes on every
request with a simple request parameter.
