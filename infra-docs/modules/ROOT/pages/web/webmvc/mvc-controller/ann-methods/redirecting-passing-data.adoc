= Redirect Attributes

By default, all model attributes are considered to be exposed as URI template variables in
the redirect URL. Of the remaining attributes, those that are primitive types or
collections or arrays of primitive types are automatically appended as query parameters.

Appending primitive type attributes as query parameters can be the desired result if a
model instance was prepared specifically for the redirect. However, in annotated
controllers, the model can contain additional attributes added for rendering purposes (for example,
drop-down field values). To avoid the possibility of having such attributes appear in the
URL, a `@RequestMapping` method can declare an argument of type `RedirectAttributes` and
use it to specify the exact attributes to make available to `RedirectView`. If the method
does redirect, the content of `RedirectAttributes` is used.  Otherwise, the content of the
model is used.

The `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` provides a flag called
`ignoreDefaultModelOnRedirect`, which you can use to indicate that the content of the default
`Model` should never be used if a controller method redirects. Instead, the controller
method should declare an attribute of type `RedirectAttributes` or, if it does not do so,
no attributes should be passed on to `RedirectView`. Both the MVC namespace and the MVC
Java configuration keep this flag set to `false`, to maintain backwards compatibility.
However, for new applications, we recommend setting it to `true`.

Note that URI template variables from the present request are automatically made
available when expanding a redirect URL, and you don't need to explicitly add them
through `Model` or `RedirectAttributes`. The following example shows how to define a redirect:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@PostMapping("/files/{path}")
public String upload(...) {
  // ...
  return "redirect:files/{path}";
}
----
======

Another way of passing data to the redirect target is by using flash attributes. Unlike
other redirect attributes, flash attributes are saved in the HTTP session (and, hence, do
not appear in the URL). See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/flash-attributes.adoc[Flash Attributes] for more information.
