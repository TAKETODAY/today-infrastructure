= Method Arguments

The next table describes the supported controller method arguments. Reactive types are not supported
for any arguments.

JDK 8's `java.util.Optional` is supported as a method argument in combination with
annotations that have a `required` attribute (for example, `@RequestParam`, `@RequestHeader`,
and others) and is equivalent to `required=false`.

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Controller method argument | Description

| `WebRequest`, `NativeWebRequest`
| Generic access to request parameters and request and session attributes, without direct
  use of the Servlet API.

| `jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest`, `jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse`
| Choose any specific request or response type -- for example, `ServletRequest`, `HttpServletRequest`,
  or Spring's `MultipartRequest`, `MultipartHttpServletRequest`.

| `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession`
| Enforces the presence of a session. As a consequence, such an argument is never `null`.
  Note that session access is not thread-safe. Consider setting the
  `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` instance's `synchronizeOnSession` flag to `true` if multiple
  requests are allowed to concurrently access a session.

| `jakarta.servlet.http.PushBuilder`
| Servlet 4.0 push builder API for programmatic HTTP/2 resource pushes.
  Note that, per the Servlet specification, the injected `PushBuilder` instance can be null if the client
  does not support that HTTP/2 feature.

| `java.security.Principal`
| Currently authenticated user -- possibly a specific `Principal` implementation class if known.

  Note that this argument is not resolved eagerly, if it is annotated in order to allow a custom resolver to resolve it
  before falling back on default resolution via `HttpServletRequest#getUserPrincipal`.
  For example, the Spring Security `Authentication` implements `Principal` and would be injected as such via
  `HttpServletRequest#getUserPrincipal`, unless it is also annotated with `@AuthenticationPrincipal` in which case it
  is resolved by a custom Spring Security resolver through `Authentication#getPrincipal`.

| `HttpMethod`
| The HTTP method of the request.

| `java.util.Locale`
| The current request locale, determined by the most specific `LocaleResolver` available (in
  effect, the configured `LocaleResolver` or `LocaleContextResolver`).

| `java.util.TimeZone` + `java.time.ZoneId`
| The time zone associated with the current request, as determined by a `LocaleContextResolver`.

| `java.io.InputStream`, `java.io.Reader`
| For access to the raw request body as exposed by the Servlet API.

| `java.io.OutputStream`, `java.io.Writer`
| For access to the raw response body as exposed by the Servlet API.

| `@PathVariable`
| For access to URI template variables. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-uri-templates[URI patterns].

| `@MatrixVariable`
| For access to name-value pairs in URI path segments. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.adoc[Matrix Variables].

| `@RequestParam`
| For access to the Servlet request parameters, including multipart files. Parameter values
  are converted to the declared method argument type. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestparam.adoc[`@RequestParam`] as well
  as xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.adoc[Multipart].

  Note that use of `@RequestParam` is optional for simple parameter values.
  See "`Any other argument`", at the end of this table.

| `@RequestHeader`
| For access to request headers. Header values are converted to the declared method argument
  type. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestheader.adoc[`@RequestHeader`].

| `@CookieValue`
| For access to cookies. Cookies values are converted to the declared method argument
  type. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/cookievalue.adoc[`@CookieValue`].

| `@RequestBody`
| For access to the HTTP request body. Body content is converted to the declared method
  argument type by using `HttpMessageConverter` implementations. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestbody.adoc[`@RequestBody`].

| `HttpEntity<B>`
| For access to request headers and body. The body is converted with an `HttpMessageConverter`.
  See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/httpentity.adoc[HttpEntity].

| `@RequestPart`
| For access to a part in a `multipart/form-data` request, converting the part's body
  with an `HttpMessageConverter`. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.adoc[Multipart].

| `java.util.Map`, `cn.taketoday.ui.Model`, `cn.taketoday.ui.ModelMap`
| For access to the model that is used in HTML controllers and exposed to templates as
  part of view rendering.

| `RedirectAttributes`
| Specify attributes to use in case of a redirect (that is, to be appended to the query
  string) and flash attributes to be stored temporarily until the request after redirect.
  See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/redirecting-passing-data.adoc[Redirect Attributes] and xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/flash-attributes.adoc[Flash Attributes].

| `@ModelAttribute`
| For access to an existing attribute in the model (instantiated if not present) with
  data binding and validation applied. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.adoc[`@ModelAttribute`] as well as
  xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.adoc[Model] and xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-initbinder.adoc[`DataBinder`].

  Note that use of `@ModelAttribute` is optional (for example, to set its attributes).
  See "`Any other argument`" at the end of this table.

| `Errors`, `BindingResult`
| For access to errors from validation and data binding for a command object
  (that is, a `@ModelAttribute` argument) or errors from the validation of a `@RequestBody` or
  `@RequestPart` arguments. You must declare an `Errors`, or `BindingResult` argument
  immediately after the validated method argument.

| `SessionStatus` + class-level `@SessionAttributes`
| For marking form processing complete, which triggers cleanup of session attributes
  declared through a class-level `@SessionAttributes` annotation. See
  xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.adoc[`@SessionAttributes`] for more details.

| `UriComponentsBuilder`
| For preparing a URL relative to the current request's host, port, scheme, context path, and
  the literal part of the servlet mapping. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-uri-building.adoc[URI Links].

| `@SessionAttribute`
| For access to any session attribute, in contrast to model attributes stored in the session
  as a result of a class-level `@SessionAttributes` declaration. See
  xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/sessionattribute.adoc[`@SessionAttribute`] for more details.

| `@RequestAttribute`
| For access to request attributes. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestattrib.adoc[`@RequestAttribute`] for more details.

| Any other argument
| If a method argument is not matched to any of the earlier values in this table and it is
  a simple type (as determined by
	{today-framework-api}/beans/BeanUtils.html#isSimpleProperty-java.lang.Class-[BeanUtils#isSimpleProperty]),
  it is resolved as a `@RequestParam`. Otherwise, it is resolved as a `@ModelAttribute`.
