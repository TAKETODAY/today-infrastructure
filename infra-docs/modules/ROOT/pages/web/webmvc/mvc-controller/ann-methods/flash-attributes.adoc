= Flash Attributes

Flash attributes provide a way for one request to store attributes that are intended for use in
another. This is most commonly needed when redirecting -- for example, the
Post-Redirect-Get pattern. Flash attributes are saved temporarily before the
redirect (typically in the session) to be made available to the request after the
redirect and are removed immediately.

Web MVC has two main abstractions in support of flash attributes. `FlashMap` is used
to hold flash attributes, while `FlashMapManager` is used to store, retrieve, and manage
`FlashMap` instances.

Flash attribute support is always "`on`" and does not need to be enabled explicitly.
However, if not used, it never causes HTTP session creation. On each request, there is an
"`input`" `FlashMap` with attributes passed from a previous request (if any) and an
"`output`" `FlashMap` with attributes to save for a subsequent request. Both `FlashMap`
instances are accessible from anywhere in Web MVC through static methods in
`RequestContextUtils`.

Annotated controllers typically do not need to work with `FlashMap` directly. Instead, a
`@RequestMapping` method can accept an argument of type `RedirectAttributes` and use it
to add flash attributes for a redirect scenario. Flash attributes added through
`RedirectAttributes` are automatically propagated to the "`output`" FlashMap. Similarly,
after the redirect, attributes from the "`input`" `FlashMap` are automatically added to the
`Model` of the controller that serves the target URL.

.Matching requests to flash attributes
****
The concept of flash attributes exists in many other web frameworks and has proven to sometimes
be exposed to concurrency issues. This is because, by definition, flash attributes
are to be stored until the next request. However the very "`next`" request may not be the
intended recipient but another asynchronous request (for example, polling or resource requests),
in which case the flash attributes are removed too early.

To reduce the possibility of such issues, `RedirectView` automatically "`stamps`"
`FlashMap` instances with the path and query parameters of the target redirect URL. In
turn, the default `FlashMapManager` matches that information to incoming requests when
it looks up the "`input`" `FlashMap`.

This does not entirely eliminate the possibility of a concurrency issue but
reduces it greatly with information that is already available in the redirect URL.
Therefore, we recommend that you use flash attributes mainly for redirect scenarios.
