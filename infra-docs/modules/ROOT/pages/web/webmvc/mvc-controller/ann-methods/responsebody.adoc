[[mvc-ann-responsebody]]
= `@ResponseBody`

You can use the `@ResponseBody` annotation on a method to have the return serialized
to the response body through an
xref:integration/rest-clients.adoc#rest-message-conversion[HttpMessageConverter].
The following listing shows an example:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@GetMapping("/accounts/{id}")
@ResponseBody
public Account handle() {
  // ...
}
----
======

`@ResponseBody` is also supported at the class level, in which case it is inherited by
all controller methods. This is the effect of `@RestController`, which is nothing more
than a meta-annotation marked with `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.

You can use `@ResponseBody` with reactive types.
See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-ann-async.adoc[Asynchronous Requests] and xref:web/webmvc/mvc-ann-async.adoc#mvc-ann-async-reactive-types[Reactive Types] for more details.

You can use the xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config/message-converters.adoc[Message Converters] option of the xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config.adoc[MVC Config] to
configure or customize message conversion.

You can combine `@ResponseBody` methods with JSON serialization views.
See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/jackson.adoc[Jackson JSON] for details.
