You can use the `@ModelAttribute` annotation:

* On a xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.adoc[method argument] in `@RequestMapping` methods
to create or access an `Object` from the model and to bind it to the request through a
`WebDataBinder`.
* As a method-level annotation in `@Controller` or `@ControllerAdvice` classes that help
to initialize the model prior to any `@RequestMapping` method invocation.
* On a `@RequestMapping` method to mark its return value is a model attribute.

This section discusses `@ModelAttribute` methods -- the second item in the preceding list.
A controller can have any number of `@ModelAttribute` methods. All such methods are
invoked before `@RequestMapping` methods in the same controller. A `@ModelAttribute`
method can also be shared across controllers through `@ControllerAdvice`. See the section on
xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-advice.adoc[Controller Advice] for more details.

`@ModelAttribute` methods have flexible method signatures. They support many of the same
arguments as `@RequestMapping` methods, except for `@ModelAttribute` itself or anything
related to the request body.

The following example shows a `@ModelAttribute` method:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@ModelAttribute
public void populateModel(@RequestParam String number, Model model) {
  model.addAttribute(accountRepository.findAccount(number));
  // add more ...
}
----

======

The following example adds only one attribute:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@ModelAttribute
public Account addAccount(@RequestParam String number) {
  return accountRepository.findAccount(number);
}
----

======


NOTE: When a name is not explicitly specified, a default name is chosen based on the `Object`
type, as explained in the javadoc for {today-framework-api}/core/Conventions.html[`Conventions`].
You can always assign an explicit name by using the overloaded `addAttribute` method or
through the `name` attribute on `@ModelAttribute` (for a return value).

You can also use `@ModelAttribute` as a method-level annotation on `@RequestMapping` methods,
in which case the return value of the `@RequestMapping` method is interpreted as a model
attribute. This is typically not required, as it is the default behavior in HTML controllers,
unless the return value is a `String` that would otherwise be interpreted as a view name.
`@ModelAttribute` can also customize the model attribute name, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@GetMapping("/accounts/{id}")
@ModelAttribute("myAccount")
public Account handle() {
  // ...
  return account;
}
----
======
