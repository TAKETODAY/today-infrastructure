= Interceptors

You can register interceptors to apply to incoming requests, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class WebConfiguration implements WebMvcConfigurer {

  @Override
  public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
    registry.addInterceptor(new LocaleChangeInterceptor());
    //registry.addInterceptor(new ThemeChangeInterceptor()).addPathPatterns("/**").excludePathPatterns("/admin/**");
  }
}
----

NOTE: Interceptors are not ideally suited as a security layer due to the potential
for a mismatch with annotated controller path matching, which can also match trailing
slashes and path extensions transparently, along with other path matching options. Many
of these options have been deprecated but the potential for a mismatch remains.
Generally, we recommend using Infra Security which includes a dedicated
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/mockApi/integrations/mvc.html#mvc-requestmatcher[MvcRequestMatcher]
to align with Web MVC path matching and also has a security firewall that blocks many
unwanted characters in URL paths.

NOTE: The XML config declares interceptors as `MappedInterceptor` beans, and those are in
turn detected by any `HandlerMapping` bean, including those from other frameworks.
By contrast, the Java config passes interceptors only to the  `HandlerMapping` beans it manages.
To re-use the same interceptors across Web MVC and other framework `HandlerMapping`
beans with the MVC Java config, either declare `MappedInterceptor` beans (and don't
manually add them in the Java config), or configure the same interceptors in both
the Java config and in other `HandlerMapping` beans.
