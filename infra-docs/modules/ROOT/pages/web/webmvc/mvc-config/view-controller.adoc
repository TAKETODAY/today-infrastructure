= View Controllers

This is a shortcut for defining a `ParameterizableViewController` that immediately
forwards to a view when invoked. You can use it in static cases when there is no Java controller
logic to run before the view generates the response.

The following example forwards a request for `/` to a view called `home`:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class WebConfiguration implements WebMvcConfigurer {

  @Override
  public void addViewControllers(ViewControllerRegistry registry) {
    registry.addViewController("/").setViewName("home");
  }
}
----

If an `@RequestMapping` method is mapped to a URL for any HTTP method then a view
controller cannot be used to handle the same URL. This is because a match by URL to an
annotated controller is considered a strong enough indication of endpoint ownership so
that a 405 (METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED), a 415 (UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE), or similar response can
be sent to the client to help with debugging. For this reason it is recommended to avoid
splitting URL handling across an annotated controller and a view controller.
