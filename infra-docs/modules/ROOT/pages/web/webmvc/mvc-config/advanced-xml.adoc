= Advanced XML Config

The MVC namespace does not have an advanced mode. If you need to customize a property on
a bean that you cannot change otherwise, you can use the `BeanPostProcessor` lifecycle
hook of the Infra `ApplicationContext`, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class MyPostProcessor implements InitializationBeanPostProcessor {

  @Override
  public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String name) throws BeansException {
    // ...
    return bean;
  }
}
----

Note that you need to declare `MyPostProcessor` as a bean, either explicitly in XML or
by letting it be detected through a `<component-scan/>` declaration.
