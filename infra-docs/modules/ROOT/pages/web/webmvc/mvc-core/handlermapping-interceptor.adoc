= Interception

All `HandlerMapping` implementations support handler interceptors that are useful when
you want to apply specific functionality to certain requests -- for example, checking for
a principal. Interceptors must implement `HandlerInterceptor` from the
`cn.taketoday.web.mockApi` package with three methods that should provide enough
flexibility to do all kinds of pre-processing and post-processing:

* `preHandle(..)`: Before the actual handler is run
* `postHandle(..)`: After the handler is run
* `afterCompletion(..)`: After the complete request has finished

The `preHandle(..)` method returns a boolean value. You can use this method to break or
continue the processing of the execution chain. When this method returns `true`, the
handler execution chain continues. When it returns false, the `MockDispatcher`
assumes the interceptor itself has taken care of requests (and, for example, rendered an
appropriate view) and does not continue executing the other interceptors and the actual
handler in the execution chain.

See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config/interceptors.adoc[Interceptors] in the section on MVC configuration for examples of how to
configure interceptors. You can also register them directly by using setters on individual
`HandlerMapping` implementations.

`postHandle` method is less useful with `@ResponseBody` and `ResponseEntity` methods for
which the response is written and committed within the `HandlerAdapter` and before
`postHandle`. That means it is too late to make any changes to the response, such as adding
an extra header. For such scenarios, you can implement `ResponseBodyAdvice` and either
declare it as an xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-advice.adoc[Controller Advice] bean or configure it directly on
`RequestMappingHandlerAdapter`.
