= Path Matching

The Servlet API exposes the full request path as `requestURI` and further sub-divides it
into `contextPath`, `servletPath`, and `pathInfo` whose values vary depending on how a
Servlet is mapped. From these inputs, Web MVC needs to determine the lookup path to
use for mapping handlers, which should exclude the `contextPath` and any `servletMapping`
prefix, if applicable.

The `servletPath` and `pathInfo` are decoded and that makes them impossible to compare
directly to the full `requestURI` in order to derive the lookupPath and that makes it
necessary to decode the `requestURI`. However this introduces its own issues because the
path may contain encoded reserved characters such as `"/"` or `";"` that can in turn
alter the structure of the path after they are decoded which can also lead to security
issues. In addition, Servlet containers may normalize the `servletPath` to varying
degrees which makes it further impossible to perform `startsWith` comparisons against
the `requestURI`.

This is why it is best to avoid reliance on the `servletPath` which comes with the
prefix-based `servletPath` mapping type. If the `MockDispatcher` is mapped as the
default Servlet with `"/"` or otherwise without a prefix with `"/*"` and the Servlet
container is 4.0+ then Web MVC is able to detect the Servlet mapping type and avoid
use of the `servletPath` and `pathInfo` altogether. On a 3.1 Servlet container,
assuming the same Servlet mapping types, the equivalent can be achieved by providing
a `UrlPathHelper` with `alwaysUseFullPath=true` via xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config/path-matching.adoc[Path Matching] in
the MVC config.

Fortunately the default Servlet mapping `"/"` is a good choice. However, there is still
an issue in that the `requestURI` needs to be decoded to make it possible to compare to
controller mappings. This is again undesirable because of the potential to decode
reserved characters that alter the path structure. If such characters are not expected,
then you can reject them (like the Infra Security HTTP firewall), or you can configure
`UrlPathHelper` with `urlDecode=false` but controller mappings will need to match to the
encoded path which may not always work well. Furthermore, sometimes the
`MockDispatcher` needs to share the URL space with another Servlet and may need to
be mapped by prefix.

The above issues are addressed when using `PathPatternParser` and parsed patterns, as
an alternative to String path matching with `AntPathMatcher`. The `PathPatternParser` has
been available for use in Web MVC from version 5.3, and is enabled by default from
version 6.0. Unlike `AntPathMatcher` which needs either the lookup path decoded or the
controller mapping encoded, a parsed `PathPattern` matches to a parsed representation
of the path called `RequestPath`, one path segment at a time. This allows decoding and
sanitizing path segment values individually without the risk of altering the structure
of the path. Parsed `PathPattern` also supports the use of `servletPath` prefix mapping
as long as a Servlet path mapping is used and the prefix is kept simple, i.e. it has no
encoded characters. For pattern syntax details and comparison, see
xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-pattern-comparison[Pattern Comparison].
