Spring Web MVC is the original web framework built on the Servlet API and has been included
in the TODAY Framework from the very beginning. The formal name, "Spring Web MVC,"
comes from the name of its source module
({today-framework-code}/spring-webmvc[`spring-webmvc`]),
but it is more commonly known as "Web MVC".

For baseline information and compatibility with Servlet container and Jakarta EE version
ranges, see the TODAY Framework
{today-framework-wiki}/Infra-Versions[Wiki].
