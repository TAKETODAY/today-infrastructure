More information on AspectJ can be found on the {aspectj-site}[AspectJ website].

_Eclipse AspectJ_ by Adrian Colyer et. al. (Addison-Wesley, 2005) provides a
comprehensive introduction and reference for the AspectJ language.

_AspectJ in Action_, Second Edition by Ramnivas Laddad (Manning, 2009) comes highly
recommended. The focus of the book is on AspectJ, but a lot of general AOP themes are
explored (in some depth).
