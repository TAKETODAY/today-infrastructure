[[aop-choosing]]
= Choosing which AOP Declaration Style to Use

Once you have decided that an aspect is the best approach for implementing a given
requirement, how do you decide between using Infra AOP or AspectJ and between the
Aspect language (code) style, the @AspectJ annotation style, or the Infra XML style? These
decisions are influenced by a number of factors including application requirements,
development tools, and team familiarity with AOP.



[[aop-spring-or-aspectj]]
== Infra AOP or Full AspectJ?

Use the simplest thing that can work. Infra AOP is simpler than using full AspectJ, as
there is no requirement to introduce the AspectJ compiler / weaver into your development
and build processes. If you only need to advise the execution of operations on Infra
beans, Infra AOP is the right choice. If you need to advise objects not managed by
the Infra container (such as domain objects, typically), you need to use
AspectJ. You also need to use AspectJ if you wish to advise join points other than
simple method executions (for example, field get or set join points and so on).

When you use AspectJ, you have the choice of the AspectJ language syntax (also known as
the "code style") or the @AspectJ annotation style. If aspects play a large
role in your design, and you are able to use the https://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/[AspectJ
Development Tools (AJDT)] plugin for Eclipse, the AspectJ language syntax is the
preferred option. It is cleaner and simpler because the language was purposefully
designed for writing aspects. If you do not use Eclipse or have only a few aspects
that do not play a major role in your application, you may want to consider using
the @AspectJ style, sticking with regular Java compilation in your IDE, and adding
an aspect weaving phase to your build script.



[[aop-ataspectj-or-xml]]
== @AspectJ or XML for Infra AOP?

If you have chosen to use Infra AOP, you have a choice of @AspectJ or XML style.
There are various tradeoffs to consider.

The XML style may be most familiar to existing Infra users, and it is backed by genuine
POJOs. When using AOP as a tool to configure enterprise services, XML can be a good
choice (a good test is whether you consider the pointcut expression to be a part of your
configuration that you might want to change independently). With the XML style, it is
arguably clearer from your configuration which aspects are present in the system.

The XML style has two disadvantages. First, it does not fully encapsulate the
implementation of the requirement it addresses in a single place. The DRY principle says
that there should be a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation of any piece of
knowledge within a system. When using the XML style, the knowledge of how a requirement
is implemented is split across the declaration of the backing bean class and the XML in
the configuration file. When you use the @AspectJ style, this information is encapsulated
in a single module: the aspect. Secondly, the XML style is slightly more limited in what
it can express than the @AspectJ style: Only the "singleton" aspect instantiation model
is supported, and it is not possible to combine named pointcuts declared in XML.
For example, in the @AspectJ style you can write something like the following:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
	@Pointcut("execution(* get*())")
	public void propertyAccess() {}

	@Pointcut("execution(com.xyz.Account+ *(..))")
	public void operationReturningAnAccount() {}

	@Pointcut("propertyAccess() && operationReturningAnAccount()")
	public void accountPropertyAccess() {}
----

======

In the XML style you can declare the first two pointcuts:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
<aop:pointcut id="propertyAccess" expression="execution(* get*())"/>

<aop:pointcut id="operationReturningAnAccount" expression="execution(com.xyz.Account+ *(..))"/>
----

The downside of the XML approach is that you cannot define the
`accountPropertyAccess` pointcut by combining these definitions.

The @AspectJ style supports additional instantiation models and richer pointcut
composition. It has the advantage of keeping the aspect as a modular unit. It also has
the advantage that the @AspectJ aspects can be understood (and thus consumed) both by
Infra AOP and by AspectJ. So, if you later decide you need the capabilities of AspectJ
to implement additional requirements, you can easily migrate to a classic AspectJ setup.
In general, the Infra team prefers the @AspectJ style for custom aspects beyond simple
configuration of enterprise services.
