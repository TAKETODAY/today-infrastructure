= Programmatic Creation of @AspectJ Proxies

In addition to declaring aspects in your configuration by using either `<aop:config>`
or `<aop:aspectj-autoproxy>`, it is also possible to programmatically create proxies
that advise target objects. For the full details of Infra AOP API, see the
xref:core/aop-api.adoc[next chapter]. Here, we want to focus on the ability to automatically
create proxies by using @AspectJ aspects.

You can use the `infra.aop.aspectj.annotation.AspectJProxyFactory` class
to create a proxy for a target object that is advised by one or more @AspectJ aspects.
The basic usage for this class is very simple, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
// create a factory that can generate a proxy for the given target object
AspectJProxyFactory factory = new AspectJProxyFactory(targetObject);

// add an aspect, the class must be an @AspectJ aspect
// you can call this as many times as you need with different aspects
factory.addAspect(SecurityManager.class);

// you can also add existing aspect instances, the type of the object supplied
// must be an @AspectJ aspect
factory.addAspect(usageTracker);

// now get the proxy object...
MyInterfaceType proxy = factory.getProxy();
----
