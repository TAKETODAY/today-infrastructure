= Infra AOP Capabilities and Goals

Infra AOP is implemented in pure Java. There is no need for a special compilation
process. Infra AOP does not need to control the class loader hierarchy and is thus
suitable for use in a servlet container or application server.

Infra AOP currently supports only method execution join points (advising the execution
of methods on Infra beans). Field interception is not implemented, although support for
field interception could be added without breaking the core Infra AOP APIs. If you need
to advise field access and update join points, consider a language such as AspectJ.

Infra AOP's approach to AOP differs from that of most other AOP frameworks. The aim is
not to provide the most complete AOP implementation (although Infra AOP is quite
capable). Rather, the aim is to provide a close integration between AOP implementation and
Infra IoC, to help solve common problems in enterprise applications.

Thus, for example, the TODAY Framework's AOP functionality is normally used in
conjunction with the Infra IoC container. Aspects are configured by using normal bean
definition syntax (although this allows powerful "auto-proxying" capabilities). This is a
crucial difference from other AOP implementations. You cannot do some things
easily or efficiently with Infra AOP, such as advise very fine-grained objects (typically,
domain objects). AspectJ is the best choice in such cases. However, our
experience is that Infra AOP provides an excellent solution to most problems in
enterprise Java applications that are amenable to AOP.

Infra AOP never strives to compete with AspectJ to provide a comprehensive AOP
solution. We believe that both proxy-based frameworks such as Infra AOP and full-blown
frameworks such as AspectJ are valuable and that they are complementary, rather than in
competition. Infra seamlessly integrates Infra AOP and IoC with AspectJ, to enable
all uses of AOP within a consistent Spring-based application
architecture. This integration does not affect the Infra AOP API or the AOP Alliance
API. Infra AOP remains backward-compatible. See xref:core/aop-api.adoc[the following chapter]
for a discussion of the Infra AOP APIs.

[NOTE]
====
One of the central tenets of the TODAY Framework is that of non-invasiveness. This
is the idea that you should not be forced to introduce framework-specific classes and
interfaces into your business or domain model. However, in some places, the TODAY Framework
does give you the option to introduce TODAY Framework-specific dependencies into your
codebase. The rationale in giving you such options is because, in certain scenarios, it
might be just plain easier to read or code some specific piece of functionality in such
a way. However, the TODAY Framework (almost) always offers you the choice: You have the
freedom to make an informed decision as to which option best suits your particular use
case or scenario.

One such choice that is relevant to this chapter is that of which AOP framework (and
which AOP style) to choose. You have the choice of AspectJ, Infra AOP, or both. You
also have the choice of either the @AspectJ annotation-style approach or the Infra XML
configuration-style approach. The fact that this chapter chooses to introduce the
@AspectJ-style approach first should not be taken as an indication that the Infra team
favors the @AspectJ annotation-style approach over the Infra XML configuration-style.

See xref:core/aop/choosing.adoc[Choosing which AOP Declaration Style to Use] for a more complete discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of
each style.
