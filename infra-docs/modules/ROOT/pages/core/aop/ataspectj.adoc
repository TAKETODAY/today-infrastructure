= @AspectJ support
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

@AspectJ refers to a style of declaring aspects as regular Java classes annotated with
annotations. The @AspectJ style was introduced by the
{aspectj-site}[AspectJ project] as part of the AspectJ 5 release. Infra
interprets the same annotations as AspectJ 5, using a library supplied by AspectJ
for pointcut parsing and matching. The AOP runtime is still pure Infra AOP, though, and
there is no dependency on the AspectJ compiler or weaver.

NOTE: Using the AspectJ compiler and weaver enables use of the full AspectJ language and
is discussed in xref:core/aop/using-aspectj.adoc[Using AspectJ with Infra Applications].
