= Enabling @AspectJ Support

To use @AspectJ aspects in a Infra configuration, you need to enable Infra support for
configuring Infra AOP based on @AspectJ aspects and auto-proxying beans based on
whether or not they are advised by those aspects. By auto-proxying, we mean that, if Infra
determines that a bean is advised by one or more aspects, it automatically generates
a proxy for that bean to intercept method invocations and ensures that advice is run
as needed.

The @AspectJ support can be enabled with programmatic or XML configuration. In either
case, you also need to ensure that AspectJ's `org.aspectj:aspectjweaver` library is on the
classpath of your application (version 1.9 or later).
