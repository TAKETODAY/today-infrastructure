= Aspect Instantiation Models

NOTE: This is an advanced topic. If you are just starting out with AOP, you can safely skip
it until later.

By default, there is a single instance of each aspect within the application
context. AspectJ calls this the singleton instantiation model. It is possible to define
aspects with alternate lifecycles. Spring supports AspectJ's `perthis`, `pertarget`, and
`pertypewithin` instantiation models; `percflow` and `percflowbelow` are not currently
supported.

You can declare a `perthis` aspect by specifying a `perthis` clause in the `@Aspect`
annotation. Consider the following example:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Aspect("perthis(execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)))")
public class MyAspect {

  private int someState;

  @Before("execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..))")
  public void recordServiceUsage() {
    // ...
  }
}
----
======

In the preceding example, the effect of the `perthis` clause is that one aspect instance
is created for each unique service object that performs a business service (each unique
object bound to `this` at join points matched by the pointcut expression). The aspect
instance is created the first time that a method is invoked on the service object. The
aspect goes out of scope when the service object goes out of scope. Before the aspect
instance is created, none of the advice within it runs. As soon as the aspect instance
has been created, the advice declared within it runs at matched join points, but only
when the service object is the one with which this aspect is associated. See the AspectJ
Programming Guide for more information on `per` clauses.

The `pertarget` instantiation model works in exactly the same way as `perthis`, but it
creates one aspect instance for each unique target object at matched join points.
