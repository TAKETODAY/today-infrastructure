= Introductions

Introductions (known as inter-type declarations in AspectJ) enable an aspect to declare
that advised objects implement a given interface, and to provide an implementation of
that interface on behalf of those objects.

You can make an introduction by using the `@DeclareParents` annotation. This annotation
is used to declare that matching types have a new parent (hence the name). For example,
given an interface named `UsageTracked` and an implementation of that interface named
`DefaultUsageTracked`, the following aspect declares that all implementors of service
interfaces also implement the `UsageTracked` interface (e.g. for statistics via JMX):

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Aspect
public class UsageTracking {

  @DeclareParents(value="com.xyz.service.*+", defaultImpl=DefaultUsageTracked.class)
  public static UsageTracked mixin;

  @Before("execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)")
  public void recordUsage(UsageTracked usageTracked) {
    usageTracked.incrementUseCount();
  }

}
----

======

The interface to be implemented is determined by the type of the annotated field. The
`value` attribute of the `@DeclareParents` annotation is an AspectJ type pattern. Any
bean of a matching type implements the `UsageTracked` interface. Note that, in the
before advice of the preceding example, service beans can be directly used as
implementations of the `UsageTracked` interface. If accessing a bean programmatically,
you would write the following:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
UsageTracked usageTracked = context.getBean("myService", UsageTracked.class);
----
