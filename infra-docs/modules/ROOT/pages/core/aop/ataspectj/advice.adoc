[[aop-advice]]
= Declaring Advice

Advice is associated with a pointcut expression and runs before, after, or around method
executions matched by the pointcut. The pointcut expression may be either an _inline
pointcut_ or a reference to a xref:core/aop/ataspectj/pointcuts.adoc#aop-common-pointcuts[_named pointcut_].


[[aop-advice-before]]
== Before Advice

You can declare before advice in an aspect by using the `@Before` annotation.

The following example uses an inline pointcut expression.

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;

@Aspect
public class BeforeExample {

  @Before("execution(* com.xyz.dao.*.*(..))")
  public void doAccessCheck() {
    // ...
  }
}
----

======

If we use a xref:core/aop/ataspectj/pointcuts.adoc#aop-common-pointcuts[named pointcut], we can rewrite the preceding example
as follows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;

@Aspect
public class BeforeExample {

  @Before("com.xyz.CommonPointcuts.dataAccessOperation()")
  public void doAccessCheck() {
    // ...
  }
}
----
======


[[aop-advice-after-returning]]
== After Returning Advice

After returning advice runs when a matched method execution returns normally.
You can declare it by using the `@AfterReturning` annotation.

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterReturning;

@Aspect
public class AfterReturningExample {

  @AfterReturning("execution(* com.xyz.dao.*.*(..))")
  public void doAccessCheck() {
    // ...
  }
}
----

======

NOTE: You can have multiple advice declarations (and other members as well),
all inside the same aspect. We show only a single advice declaration in these
examples to focus the effect of each one.

Sometimes, you need access in the advice body to the actual value that was returned.
You can use the form of `@AfterReturning` that binds the return value to get that
access, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterReturning;

@Aspect
public class AfterReturningExample {

  @AfterReturning(
    pointcut="execution(* com.xyz.dao.*.*(..))",
    returning="retVal")
  public void doAccessCheck(Object retVal) {
    // ...
  }
}
----

======

The name used in the `returning` attribute must correspond to the name of a parameter
in the advice method. When a method execution returns, the return value is passed to
the advice method as the corresponding argument value. A `returning` clause also
restricts matching to only those method executions that return a value of the
specified type (in this case, `Object`, which matches any return value).

Please note that it is not possible to return a totally different reference when
using after returning advice.


[[aop-advice-after-throwing]]
== After Throwing Advice

After throwing advice runs when a matched method execution exits by throwing an
exception. You can declare it by using the `@AfterThrowing` annotation, as the
following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterThrowing;

@Aspect
public class AfterThrowingExample {

  @AfterThrowing("execution(* com.xyz.dao.*.*(..))")
  public void doRecoveryActions() {
    // ...
  }
}
----

======

Often, you want the advice to run only when exceptions of a given type are thrown,
and you also often need access to the thrown exception in the advice body. You can
use the `throwing` attribute to both restrict matching (if desired -- use `Throwable`
as the exception type otherwise) and bind the thrown exception to an advice parameter.
The following example shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterThrowing;

@Aspect
public class AfterThrowingExample {

  @AfterThrowing(
    pointcut="execution(* com.xyz.dao.*.*(..))",
    throwing="ex")
  public void doRecoveryActions(DataAccessException ex) {
    // ...
  }
}
----

======

The name used in the `throwing` attribute must correspond to the name of a parameter in
the advice method. When a method execution exits by throwing an exception, the exception
is passed to the advice method as the corresponding argument value. A `throwing` clause
also restricts matching to only those method executions that throw an exception of the
specified type (`DataAccessException`, in this case).

[NOTE]
====
Note that `@AfterThrowing` does not indicate a general exception handling callback.
Specifically, an `@AfterThrowing` advice method is only supposed to receive exceptions
from the join point (user-declared target method) itself but not from an accompanying
`@After`/`@AfterReturning` method.
====


[[aop-advice-after-finally]]
== After (Finally) Advice

After (finally) advice runs when a matched method execution exits. It is declared by
using the `@After` annotation. After advice must be prepared to handle both normal and
exception return conditions. It is typically used for releasing resources and similar
purposes. The following example shows how to use after finally advice:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.After;

@Aspect
public class AfterFinallyExample {

  @After("execution(* com.xyz.dao.*.*(..))")
  public void doReleaseLock() {
    // ...
  }
}
----

======

[NOTE]
====
Note that `@After` advice in AspectJ is defined as "after finally advice", analogous
to a finally block in a try-catch statement. It will be invoked for any outcome,
normal return or exception thrown from the join point (user-declared target method),
in contrast to `@AfterReturning` which only applies to successful normal returns.
====


[[aop-ataspectj-around-advice]]
== Around Advice

The last kind of advice is _around_ advice. Around advice runs "around" a matched
method's execution. It has the opportunity to do work both before and after the method
runs and to determine when, how, and even if the method actually gets to run at all.
Around advice is often used if you need to share state before and after a method
execution in a thread-safe manner â€“ for example, starting and stopping a timer.

[TIP]
====
Always use the least powerful form of advice that meets your requirements.

For example, do not use _around_ advice if _before_ advice is sufficient for your needs.
====

Around advice is declared by annotating a method with the `@Around` annotation. The
method should declare `Object` as its return type, and the first parameter of the method
must be of type `ProceedingJoinPoint`. Within the body of the advice method, you must
invoke `proceed()` on the `ProceedingJoinPoint` in order for the underlying method to
run. Invoking `proceed()` without arguments will result in the caller's original
arguments being supplied to the underlying method when it is invoked. For advanced use
cases, there is an overloaded variant of the `proceed()` method which accepts an array of
arguments (`Object[]`). The values in the array will be used as the arguments to the
underlying method when it is invoked.

[NOTE]
====
The behavior of `proceed` when called with an `Object[]` is a little different than the
behavior of `proceed` for around advice compiled by the AspectJ compiler. For around
advice written using the traditional AspectJ language, the number of arguments passed to
`proceed` must match the number of arguments passed to the around advice (not the number
of arguments taken by the underlying join point), and the value passed to proceed in a
given argument position supplants the original value at the join point for the entity the
value was bound to (do not worry if this does not make sense right now).

The approach taken by Infra is simpler and a better match to its proxy-based,
execution-only semantics. You only need to be aware of this difference if you compile
`@AspectJ` aspects written for Infra and use `proceed` with arguments with the AspectJ
compiler and weaver. There is a way to write such aspects that is 100% compatible across
both Infra AOP and AspectJ, and this is discussed in the
xref:core/aop/ataspectj/advice.adoc#aop-ataspectj-advice-proceeding-with-the-call[following section on advice parameters].
====

The value returned by the around advice is the return value seen by the caller of the
method. For example, a simple caching aspect could return a value from a cache if it has
one or invoke `proceed()` (and return that value) if it does not. Note that `proceed`
may be invoked once, many times, or not at all within the body of the around advice. All
of these are legal.

WARNING: If you declare the return type of your around advice method as `void`, `null`
will always be returned to the caller, effectively ignoring the result of any invocation
of `proceed()`. It is therefore recommended that an around advice method declare a return
type of `Object`. The advice method should typically return the value returned from an
invocation of `proceed()`, even if the underlying method has a `void` return type.
However, the advice may optionally return a cached value, a wrapped value, or some other
value depending on the use case.

The following example shows how to use around advice:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Around;
import org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint;

@Aspect
public class AroundExample {

  @Around("execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..))")
  public Object doBasicProfiling(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
    // start stopwatch
    Object retVal = pjp.proceed();
    // stop stopwatch
    return retVal;
  }
}
----

======

[[aop-ataspectj-advice-params]]
== Advice Parameters

Infra offers fully typed advice, meaning that you declare the parameters you need in the
advice signature (as we saw earlier for the returning and throwing examples) rather than
work with `Object[]` arrays all the time. We see how to make argument and other contextual
values available to the advice body later in this section. First, we take a look at how to
write generic advice that can find out about the method the advice is currently advising.

[[aop-ataspectj-advice-params-the-joinpoint]]
=== Access to the Current `JoinPoint`

Any advice method may declare, as its first parameter, a parameter of type
`org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint`. Note that around advice is required to declare a first
parameter of type `ProceedingJoinPoint`, which is a subclass of `JoinPoint`.

The `JoinPoint` interface provides a number of useful methods:

* `getArgs()`: Returns the method arguments.
* `getThis()`: Returns the proxy object.
* `getTarget()`: Returns the target object.
* `getSignature()`: Returns a description of the method that is being advised.
* `toString()`: Prints a useful description of the method being advised.

See the {aspectj-api}/org/aspectj/lang/JoinPoint.html[javadoc] for more detail.

[[aop-ataspectj-advice-params-passing]]
=== Passing Parameters to Advice

We have already seen how to bind the returned value or exception value (using after
returning and after throwing advice). To make argument values available to the advice
body, you can use the binding form of `args`. If you use a parameter name in place of a
type name in an `args` expression, the value of the corresponding argument is passed as
the parameter value when the advice is invoked. An example should make this clearer.
Suppose you want to advise the execution of DAO operations that take an `Account`
object as the first parameter, and you need access to the account in the advice body.
You could write the following:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Before("execution(* com.xyz.dao.*.*(..)) && args(account,..)")
public void validateAccount(Account account) {
  // ...
}
----

======

The `args(account,..)` part of the pointcut expression serves two purposes. First, it
restricts matching to only those method executions where the method takes at least one
parameter, and the argument passed to that parameter is an instance of `Account`.
Second, it makes the actual `Account` object available to the advice through the `account`
parameter.

Another way of writing this is to declare a pointcut that "provides" the `Account`
object value when it matches a join point, and then refer to the named pointcut
from the advice. This would look as follows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Pointcut("execution(* com.xyz.dao.*.*(..)) && args(account,..)")
private void accountDataAccessOperation(Account account) {}

@Before("accountDataAccessOperation(account)")
public void validateAccount(Account account) {
  // ...
}
----

======

See the AspectJ programming guide for more details.

The proxy object (`this`), target object (`target`), and annotations (`@within`,
`@target`, `@annotation`, and `@args`) can all be bound in a similar fashion. The next
set of examples shows how to match the execution of methods annotated with an
`@Auditable` annotation and extract the audit code:

The following shows the definition of the `@Auditable` annotation:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface Auditable {
  AuditCode value();
}
----
======

The following shows the advice that matches the execution of `@Auditable` methods:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Before("com.xyz.Pointcuts.publicMethod() && @annotation(auditable)") // <1>
public void audit(Auditable auditable) {
  AuditCode code = auditable.value();
  // ...
}
----
<1> References the `publicMethod` named pointcut defined in xref:core/aop/ataspectj/pointcuts.adoc#aop-pointcuts-combining[Combining Pointcut Expressions].

======

[[aop-ataspectj-advice-params-generics]]
=== Advice Parameters and Generics

Infra AOP can handle generics used in class declarations and method parameters. Suppose
you have a generic type like the following:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
public interface Sample<T> {
  void sampleGenericMethod(T param);
  void sampleGenericCollectionMethod(Collection<T> param);
}
----

======

You can restrict interception of method types to certain parameter types by
tying the advice parameter to the parameter type for which you want to intercept the method:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Before("execution(* ..Sample+.sampleGenericMethod(*)) && args(param)")
public void beforeSampleMethod(MyType param) {
  // Advice implementation
}
----

======

This approach does not work for generic collections. So you cannot define a
pointcut as follows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Before("execution(* ..Sample+.sampleGenericCollectionMethod(*)) && args(param)")
public void beforeSampleMethod(Collection<MyType> param) {
  // Advice implementation
}
----

======

To make this work, we would have to inspect every element of the collection, which is not
reasonable, as we also cannot decide how to treat `null` values in general. To achieve
something similar to this, you have to type the parameter to `Collection<?>` and manually
check the type of the elements.

[[aop-ataspectj-advice-params-names]]
=== Determining Argument Names

Parameter binding in advice invocations relies on matching the names used in pointcut
expressions to the parameter names declared in advice and pointcut method signatures.

NOTE: This section uses the terms _argument_ and _parameter_ interchangeably, since
AspectJ APIs refer to parameter names as argument names.

Infra AOP uses the following `ParameterNameDiscoverer` implementations to determine
parameter names. Each discoverer will be given a chance to discover parameter names, and
the first successful discoverer wins. If none of the registered discoverers is capable
of determining parameter names, an exception will be thrown.

`AspectJAnnotationParameterNameDiscoverer` :: Uses parameter names that have been explicitly
  specified by the user via the `argNames` attribute in the corresponding advice or
  pointcut annotation. See xref:core/aop/ataspectj/advice.adoc#aop-ataspectj-advice-params-names-explicit[Explicit Argument Names] for details.
`KotlinReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer` :: Uses Kotlin reflection APIs to determine
  parameter names. This discoverer is only used if such APIs are present on the classpath.
`StandardReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer` :: Uses the standard `java.lang.reflect.Parameter`
  API to determine parameter names. Requires that code be compiled with the `-parameters`
  flag for `javac`. Recommended approach on Java 8+.
`AspectJAdviceParameterNameDiscoverer` :: Deduces parameter names from the pointcut
  expression, `returning`, and `throwing` clauses. See the
  {today-framework-api}/aop/aspectj/AspectJAdviceParameterNameDiscoverer.html[javadoc]
  for details on the algorithm used.

[[aop-ataspectj-advice-params-names-explicit]]
=== Explicit Argument Names

@AspectJ advice and pointcut annotations have an optional `argNames` attribute that you
can use to specify the argument names of the annotated method.

[TIP]
====
If an @AspectJ aspect has been compiled by the AspectJ compiler (`ajc`) even without
debug information, you do not need to add the `argNames` attribute, since the compiler
retains the needed information.

Similarly, if an @AspectJ aspect has been compiled with `javac` using the `-parameters`
flag, you do not need to add the `argNames` attribute, since the compiler retains the
needed information.
====

The following example shows how to use the `argNames` attribute:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Before(value = "com.xyz.Pointcuts.publicMethod() && target(bean) && @annotation(auditable)", // <1>
  argNames = "bean,auditable") // <2>
public void audit(Object bean, Auditable auditable) {
  AuditCode code = auditable.value();
  // ... use code and bean
}
----
<1> References the `publicMethod` named pointcut defined in xref:core/aop/ataspectj/pointcuts.adoc#aop-pointcuts-combining[Combining Pointcut Expressions].
<2> Declares `bean` and `auditable` as the argument names.
======

If the first parameter is of type `JoinPoint`, `ProceedingJoinPoint`, or
`JoinPoint.StaticPart`, you can omit the name of the parameter from the value of the
`argNames` attribute. For example, if you modify the preceding advice to receive the join
point object, the `argNames` attribute does not need to include it:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Before(value = "com.xyz.Pointcuts.publicMethod() && target(bean) && @annotation(auditable)", // <1>
  argNames = "bean,auditable") // <2>
public void audit(JoinPoint jp, Object bean, Auditable auditable) {
  AuditCode code = auditable.value();
  // ... use code, bean, and jp
}
----
<1> References the `publicMethod` named pointcut defined in xref:core/aop/ataspectj/pointcuts.adoc#aop-pointcuts-combining[Combining Pointcut Expressions].
<2> Declares `bean` and `auditable` as the argument names.

======

The special treatment given to the first parameter of type `JoinPoint`,
`ProceedingJoinPoint`, or `JoinPoint.StaticPart` is particularly convenient for advice
methods that do not collect any other join point context. In such situations, you may
omit the `argNames` attribute. For example, the following advice does not need to declare
the `argNames` attribute:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Before("com.xyz.Pointcuts.publicMethod()") // <1>
public void audit(JoinPoint jp) {
  // ... use jp
}
----
<1> References the `publicMethod` named pointcut defined in xref:core/aop/ataspectj/pointcuts.adoc#aop-pointcuts-combining[Combining Pointcut Expressions].

======


[[aop-ataspectj-advice-proceeding-with-the-call]]
=== Proceeding with Arguments

We remarked earlier that we would describe how to write a `proceed` call with
arguments that works consistently across Infra AOP and AspectJ. The solution is
to ensure that the advice signature binds each of the method parameters in order.
The following example shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim",role="primary"]
----
@Around("execution(List<Account> find*(..)) && " +
    "com.xyz.CommonPointcuts.inDataAccessLayer() && " +
    "args(accountHolderNamePattern)") // <1>
public Object preProcessQueryPattern(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp,
    String accountHolderNamePattern) throws Throwable {
  String newPattern = preProcess(accountHolderNamePattern);
  return pjp.proceed(new Object[] {newPattern});
}
----
<1> References the `inDataAccessLayer` named pointcut defined in xref:core/aop/ataspectj/pointcuts.adoc#aop-common-pointcuts[Sharing Named Pointcut Definitions].
======

In many cases, you do this binding anyway (as in the preceding example).


[[aop-ataspectj-advice-ordering]]
== Advice Ordering

What happens when multiple pieces of advice all want to run at the same join point?
Infra AOP follows the same precedence rules as AspectJ to determine the order of advice
execution. The highest precedence advice runs first "on the way in" (so, given two pieces
of before advice, the one with highest precedence runs first). "On the way out" from a
join point, the highest precedence advice runs last (so, given two pieces of after
advice, the one with the highest precedence will run second).

When two pieces of advice defined in different aspects both need to run at the same
join point, unless you specify otherwise, the order of execution is undefined. You can
control the order of execution by specifying precedence. This is done in the normal
Infra way by either implementing the `infra.core.Ordered` interface in
the aspect class or annotating it with the `@Order` annotation. Given two aspects, the
aspect returning the lower value from `Ordered.getOrder()` (or the annotation value) has
the higher precedence.

[NOTE]
====
Each of the distinct advice types of a particular aspect is conceptually meant to apply
to the join point directly. As a consequence, an `@AfterThrowing` advice method is not
supposed to receive an exception from an accompanying `@After`/`@AfterReturning` method.

advice methods defined in the same `@Aspect` class that
need to run at the same join point are assigned precedence based on their advice type in
the following order, from highest to lowest precedence: `@Around`, `@Before`, `@After`,
`@AfterReturning`, `@AfterThrowing`. Note, however, that an `@After` advice method will
effectively be invoked after any `@AfterReturning` or `@AfterThrowing` advice methods
in the same aspect, following AspectJ's "after finally advice" semantics for `@After`.

When two pieces of the same type of advice (for example, two `@After` advice methods)
defined in the same `@Aspect` class both need to run at the same join point, the ordering
is undefined (since there is no way to retrieve the source code declaration order through
reflection for javac-compiled classes). Consider collapsing such advice methods into one
advice method per join point in each `@Aspect` class or refactor the pieces of advice into
separate `@Aspect` classes that you can order at the aspect level via `Ordered` or `@Order`.
