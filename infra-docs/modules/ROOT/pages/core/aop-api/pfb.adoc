= Using the `ProxyFactoryBean` to Create AOP Proxies

If you use the Infra IoC container (an `ApplicationContext` or `BeanFactory`) for your
business objects (and you should be!), you want to use one of Infra AOP
`FactoryBean` implementations. (Remember that a factory bean introduces a layer of indirection, letting
it create objects of a different type.)

NOTE: The Infra AOP support also uses factory beans under the covers.

The basic way to create an AOP proxy in Infra is to use the
`cn.taketoday.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean`. This gives complete control over
the pointcuts, any advice that applies, and their ordering. However, there are simpler
options that are preferable if you do not need such control.



[[aop-pfb-1]]
== Basics

The `ProxyFactoryBean`, like other Infra `FactoryBean` implementations, introduces a
level of indirection. If you define a `ProxyFactoryBean` named `foo`, objects that
reference `foo` do not see the `ProxyFactoryBean` instance itself but an object
created by the implementation of the `getObject()` method in the `ProxyFactoryBean` . This
method creates an AOP proxy that wraps a target object.

One of the most important benefits of using a `ProxyFactoryBean` or another IoC-aware
class to create AOP proxies is that advice and pointcuts can also be
managed by IoC. This is a powerful feature, enabling certain approaches that are hard to
achieve with other AOP frameworks. For example, an advice may itself reference
application objects (besides the target, which should be available in any AOP
framework), benefiting from all the pluggability provided by Dependency Injection.



[[aop-pfb-2]]
== JavaBean Properties

In common with most `FactoryBean` implementations provided with Infra-, the
`ProxyFactoryBean` class is itself a JavaBean. Its properties are used to:

* Specify the target you want to proxy.
* Specify whether to use CGLIB (described later and see also xref:core/aop-api/pfb.adoc#aop-pfb-proxy-types[JDK- and CGLIB-based proxies]).

Some key properties are inherited from `cn.taketoday.aop.framework.ProxyConfig`
(the superclass for all AOP proxy factories in Infra). These key properties include
the following:

* `proxyTargetClass`: `true` if the target class is to be proxied, rather than the
  target class's interfaces. If this property value is set to `true`, then CGLIB proxies
  are created (but see also xref:core/aop-api/pfb.adoc#aop-pfb-proxy-types[JDK- and CGLIB-based proxies]).
* `optimize`: Controls whether or not aggressive optimizations are applied to proxies
  created through CGLIB. You should not blithely use this setting unless you fully
  understand how the relevant AOP proxy handles optimization. This is currently used
  only for CGLIB proxies. It has no effect with JDK dynamic proxies.
* `frozen`: If a proxy configuration is `frozen`, changes to the configuration are
  no longer allowed. This is useful both as a slight optimization and for those cases
  when you do not want callers to be able to manipulate the proxy (through the `Advised`
  interface) after the proxy has been created. The default value of this property is
  `false`, so changes (such as adding additional advice) are allowed.
* `exposeProxy`: Determines whether or not the current proxy should be exposed in a
  `ThreadLocal` so that it can be accessed by the target. If a target needs to obtain
  the proxy and the `exposeProxy` property is set to `true`, the target can use the
  `AopContext.currentProxy()` method.

Other properties specific to `ProxyFactoryBean` include the following:

* `proxyInterfaces`: An array of `String` interface names. If this is not supplied, a CGLIB
  proxy for the target class is used (but see also xref:core/aop-api/pfb.adoc#aop-pfb-proxy-types[JDK- and CGLIB-based proxies]).
* `interceptorNames`: A `String` array of `Advisor`, interceptor, or other advice names to
  apply. Ordering is significant, on a first come-first served basis. That is to say
  that the first interceptor in the list is the first to be able to intercept the
  invocation.
+
The names are bean names in the current factory, including bean names from ancestor
factories. You cannot mention bean references here, since doing so results in the
`ProxyFactoryBean` ignoring the singleton setting of the advice.
+
You can append an interceptor name with an asterisk (`*`). Doing so results in the
application of all advisor beans with names that start with the part before the asterisk
to be applied. You can find an example of using this feature in xref:core/aop-api/pfb.adoc#aop-global-advisors[Using "`Global`" Advisors].

* singleton: Whether or not the factory should return a single object, no matter how
  often the `getObject()` method is called. Several `FactoryBean` implementations offer
  such a method. The default value is `true`. If you want to use stateful advice - for
  example, for stateful mixins - use prototype advice along with a singleton value of
  `false`.



[[aop-pfb-proxy-types]]
== JDK- and CGLIB-based proxies

This section serves as the definitive documentation on how the `ProxyFactoryBean`
chooses to create either a JDK-based proxy or a CGLIB-based proxy for a particular target
object (which is to be proxied).

NOTE: The behavior of the `ProxyFactoryBean` with regard to creating JDK- or CGLIB-based
proxies changed between versions 1.2.x and 2.0 of Infra. The `ProxyFactoryBean` now
exhibits similar semantics with regard to auto-detecting interfaces as those of the
`TransactionProxyFactoryBean` class.

If the class of a target object that is to be proxied (hereafter simply referred to as
the target class) does not implement any interfaces, a CGLIB-based proxy is
created. This is the easiest scenario, because JDK proxies are interface-based, and no
interfaces means JDK proxying is not even possible. You can plug in the target bean
and specify the list of interceptors by setting the `interceptorNames` property. Note that a
CGLIB-based proxy is created even if the `proxyTargetClass` property of the
`ProxyFactoryBean` has been set to `false`. (Doing so makes no sense and is best
removed from the bean definition, because it is, at best, redundant, and, at worst
confusing.)

If the target class implements one (or more) interfaces, the type of proxy that is
created depends on the configuration of the `ProxyFactoryBean`.

If the `proxyTargetClass` property of the `ProxyFactoryBean` has been set to `true`,
a CGLIB-based proxy is created. This makes sense and is in keeping with the
principle of least surprise. Even if the `proxyInterfaces` property of the
`ProxyFactoryBean` has been set to one or more fully qualified interface names, the fact
that the `proxyTargetClass` property is set to `true` causes CGLIB-based
proxying to be in effect.

If the `proxyInterfaces` property of the `ProxyFactoryBean` has been set to one or more
fully qualified interface names, a JDK-based proxy is created. The created
proxy implements all of the interfaces that were specified in the `proxyInterfaces`
property. If the target class happens to implement a whole lot more interfaces than
those specified in the `proxyInterfaces` property, that is all well and good, but those
additional interfaces are not implemented by the returned proxy.

If the `proxyInterfaces` property of the `ProxyFactoryBean` has not been set, but
the target class does implement one (or more) interfaces, the
`ProxyFactoryBean` auto-detects the fact that the target class does actually
implement at least one interface, and a JDK-based proxy is created. The interfaces
that are actually proxied are all of the interfaces that the target class
implements. In effect, this is the same as supplying a list of each and every
interface that the target class implements to the `proxyInterfaces` property. However,
it is significantly less work and less prone to typographical errors.



[[aop-api-proxying-intf]]
== Proxying Interfaces

Consider a simple example of `ProxyFactoryBean` in action. This example involves:

* A target bean that is proxied. This is the `personTarget` bean definition in
  the example.
* An `Advisor` and an `Interceptor` used to provide advice.
* An AOP proxy bean definition to specify the target object (the `personTarget` bean),
  the interfaces to proxy, and the advice to apply.

The following listing shows the example:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="personTarget" class="com.mycompany.PersonImpl">
  <property name="name" value="Tony"/>
  <property name="age" value="51"/>
</bean>

<bean id="myAdvisor" class="com.mycompany.MyAdvisor">
  <property name="someProperty" value="Custom string property value"/>
</bean>

<bean id="debugInterceptor" class="cn.taketoday.aop.interceptor.DebugInterceptor">
</bean>

<bean id="person"
  class="cn.taketoday.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="proxyInterfaces" value="com.mycompany.Person"/>

  <property name="target" ref="personTarget"/>
  <property name="interceptorNames">
    <list>
      <value>myAdvisor</value>
      <value>debugInterceptor</value>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>
----

Note that the `interceptorNames` property takes a list of `String`, which holds the bean names of the
interceptors or advisors in the current factory. You can use advisors, interceptors, before, after
returning, and throws advice objects. The ordering of advisors is significant.

NOTE: You might be wondering why the list does not hold bean references. The reason for this is
that, if the singleton property of the `ProxyFactoryBean` is set to `false`, it must be able to
return independent proxy instances. If any of the advisors is itself a prototype, an
independent instance would need to be returned, so it is necessary to be able to obtain
an instance of the prototype from the factory. Holding a reference is not sufficient.

The `person` bean definition shown earlier can be used in place of a `Person` implementation, as
follows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	Person person = (Person) factory.getBean("person");
----

======

Other beans in the same IoC context can express a strongly typed dependency on it, as
with an ordinary Java object. The following example shows how to do so:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="personUser" class="com.mycompany.PersonUser">
  <property name="person"><ref bean="person"/></property>
</bean>
----

The `PersonUser` class in this example exposes a property of type `Person`. As far as
it is concerned, the AOP proxy can be used transparently in place of a "`real`" person
implementation. However, its class would be a dynamic proxy class. It would be possible
to cast it to the `Advised` interface (discussed later).

You can conceal the distinction between target and proxy by using an anonymous
inner bean. Only the `ProxyFactoryBean` definition is different. The
advice is included only for completeness. The following example shows how to use an
anonymous inner bean:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="myAdvisor" class="com.mycompany.MyAdvisor">
  <property name="someProperty" value="Custom string property value"/>
</bean>

<bean id="debugInterceptor" class="cn.taketoday.aop.interceptor.DebugInterceptor"/>

<bean id="person" class="cn.taketoday.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="proxyInterfaces" value="com.mycompany.Person"/>
  <!-- Use inner bean, not local reference to target -->
  <property name="target">
    <bean class="com.mycompany.PersonImpl">
      <property name="name" value="Tony"/>
      <property name="age" value="51"/>
    </bean>
  </property>
  <property name="interceptorNames">
    <list>
      <value>myAdvisor</value>
      <value>debugInterceptor</value>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>
----

Using an anonymous inner bean has the advantage that there is only one object of type `Person`. This is useful if we want
to prevent users of the application context from obtaining a reference to the un-advised
object or need to avoid any ambiguity with Infra IoC autowiring. There is also,
arguably, an advantage in that the `ProxyFactoryBean` definition is self-contained.
However, there are times when being able to obtain the un-advised target from the
factory might actually be an advantage (for example, in certain test scenarios).



[[aop-api-proxying-class]]
== Proxying Classes

What if you need to proxy a class, rather than one or more interfaces?

Imagine that in our earlier example, there was no `Person` interface. We needed to advise
a class called `Person` that did not implement any business interface. In this case, you
can configure Infra to use CGLIB proxying rather than dynamic proxies. To do so, set the
`proxyTargetClass` property on the `ProxyFactoryBean` shown earlier to `true`. While it is best to
program to interfaces rather than classes, the ability to advise classes that do not
implement interfaces can be useful when working with legacy code. (In general, Infra
is not prescriptive. While it makes it easy to apply good practices, it avoids forcing a
particular approach.)

If you want to, you can force the use of CGLIB in any case, even if you do have
interfaces.

CGLIB proxying works by generating a subclass of the target class at runtime. Infra
configures this generated subclass to delegate method calls to the original target. The
subclass is used to implement the Decorator pattern, weaving in the advice.

CGLIB proxying should generally be transparent to users. However, there are some issues
to consider:

* `final` classes cannot be proxied, because they cannot be extended.
* `final` methods cannot be advised, because they cannot be overridden.
* `private` methods cannot be advised, because they cannot be overridden.
* Methods that are not visible, typically package private methods in a parent class
from a different package, cannot be advised because they are effectively private.

NOTE: There is no need to add CGLIB to your classpath. CGLIB is repackaged and included
in the `today-core` JAR. In other words, CGLIB-based AOP works "out of the box", as do
JDK dynamic proxies.

There is little performance difference between CGLIB proxies and dynamic proxies.
Performance should not be a decisive consideration in this case.



[[aop-global-advisors]]
== Using "`Global`" Advisors

By appending an asterisk to an interceptor name, all advisors with bean names that match
the part before the asterisk are added to the advisor chain. This can come in handy
if you need to add a standard set of "`global`" advisors. The following example defines
two global advisors:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="proxy" class="cn.taketoday.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="target" ref="service"/>
  <property name="interceptorNames">
    <list>
      <value>global*</value>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>

<bean id="global_debug" class="cn.taketoday.aop.interceptor.DebugInterceptor"/>
<bean id="global_performance" class="cn.taketoday.aop.interceptor.PerformanceMonitorInterceptor"/>
----
