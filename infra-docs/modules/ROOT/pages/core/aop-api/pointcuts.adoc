[[aop-api-pointcuts]]
= Pointcut API in Infra

This section describes how Infra handles the crucial pointcut concept.



[[aop-api-concepts]]
== Concepts

Infra pointcut model enables pointcut reuse independent of advice types. You can
target different advice with the same pointcut.

The `infra.aop.Pointcut` interface is the central interface, used to
target advice to particular classes and methods. The complete interface follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface Pointcut {

  ClassFilter getClassFilter();

  MethodMatcher getMethodMatcher();
}
----

Splitting the `Pointcut` interface into two parts allows reuse of class and method
matching parts and fine-grained composition operations (such as performing a "`union`"
with another method matcher).

The `ClassFilter` interface is used to restrict the pointcut to a given set of target
classes. If the `matches()` method always returns true, all target classes are
matched. The following listing shows the `ClassFilter` interface definition:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface ClassFilter {

  boolean matches(Class clazz);
}
----

The `MethodMatcher` interface is normally more important. The complete interface follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface MethodMatcher {

  boolean matches(Method m, Class<?> targetClass);

  boolean isRuntime();

  boolean matches(Method m, Class<?> targetClass, Object... args);
}
----

The `matches(Method, Class)` method is used to test whether this pointcut ever
matches a given method on a target class. This evaluation can be performed when an AOP
proxy is created to avoid the need for a test on every method invocation. If the
two-argument `matches` method returns `true` for a given method, and the `isRuntime()`
method for the MethodMatcher returns `true`, the three-argument matches method is
invoked on every method invocation. This lets a pointcut look at the arguments passed
to the method invocation immediately before the target advice starts.

Most `MethodMatcher` implementations are static, meaning that their `isRuntime()` method
returns `false`. In this case, the three-argument `matches` method is never invoked.

TIP: If possible, try to make pointcuts static, allowing the AOP framework to cache the
results of pointcut evaluation when an AOP proxy is created.



[[aop-api-pointcut-ops]]
== Operations on Pointcuts

Infra supports operations (notably, union and intersection) on pointcuts.

Union means the methods that either pointcut matches.
Intersection means the methods that both pointcuts match.
Union is usually more useful.
You can compose pointcuts by using the static methods in the
`infra.aop.support.Pointcuts` class or by using the
`ComposablePointcut` class in the same package. However, using AspectJ pointcut
expressions is usually a simpler approach.



[[aop-api-pointcuts-aspectj]]
== AspectJ Expression Pointcuts

Since 2.0, the most important type of pointcut used by Infra is
`infra.aop.aspectj.AspectJExpressionPointcut`. This is a pointcut that
uses an AspectJ-supplied library to parse an AspectJ pointcut expression string.

See the xref:core/aop.adoc[previous chapter] for a discussion of supported AspectJ pointcut primitives.



[[aop-api-pointcuts-impls]]
== Convenience Pointcut Implementations

Infra provides several convenient pointcut implementations. You can use some of them
directly; others are intended to be subclassed in application-specific pointcuts.


[[aop-api-pointcuts-static]]
=== Static Pointcuts

Static pointcuts are based on the method and the target class and cannot take into account
the method's arguments. Static pointcuts suffice -- and are best -- for most usages.
Infra can evaluate a static pointcut only once, when a method is first invoked.
After that, there is no need to evaluate the pointcut again with each method invocation.

The rest of this section describes some of the static pointcut implementations that are
included with Infra.

[[aop-api-pointcuts-regex]]
==== Regular Expression Pointcuts

One obvious way to specify static pointcuts is regular expressions. Several AOP
frameworks besides Infra make this possible.
`infra.aop.support.JdkRegexpMethodPointcut` is a generic regular
expression pointcut that uses the regular expression support in the JDK.

With the `JdkRegexpMethodPointcut` class, you can provide a list of pattern strings.
If any of these is a match, the pointcut evaluates to `true`. (As a consequence,
the resulting pointcut is effectively the union of the specified patterns.)

The following example shows how to use `JdkRegexpMethodPointcut`:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class JdkRegexpConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public JdkRegexpMethodPointcut settersAndAbsquatulatePointcut() {
    JdkRegexpMethodPointcut pointcut = new JdkRegexpMethodPointcut();
    pointcut.setPatterns(".*set.*", ".*absquatulate");
    return pointcut;
  }
}
----

Infra provides a convenience class named `RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor`, which lets us
also reference an `Advice` (remember that an `Advice` can be an interceptor, before advice,
throws advice, and others). Behind the scenes, Infra uses a `JdkRegexpMethodPointcut`.
Using `RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor` simplifies wiring, as the one bean encapsulates both
pointcut and advice, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class RegexpConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor settersAndAbsquatulateAdvisor(Advice beanNameOfAopAllianceInterceptor) {
    RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor advisor = new RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor();
    advisor.setAdvice(beanNameOfAopAllianceInterceptor);
    advisor.setPatterns(".*set.*", ".*absquatulate");
    return advisor;
  }
}
----

You can use `RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor` with any `Advice` type.

[[aop-api-pointcuts-attribute-driven]]
==== Attribute-driven Pointcuts

An important type of static pointcut is a metadata-driven pointcut. This uses the
values of metadata attributes (typically, source-level metadata).


[[aop-api-pointcuts-dynamic]]
=== Dynamic pointcuts

Dynamic pointcuts are costlier to evaluate than static pointcuts. They take into account
method arguments as well as static information. This means that they must be
evaluated with every method invocation and that the result cannot be cached, as arguments will
vary.

The main example is the `control flow` pointcut.

[[aop-api-pointcuts-cflow]]
==== Control Flow Pointcuts

Infra control flow pointcuts are conceptually similar to AspectJ `cflow` pointcuts,
although less powerful. (There is currently no way to specify that a pointcut runs
below a join point matched by another pointcut.) A control flow pointcut matches the
current call stack. For example, it might fire if the join point was invoked by a method
in the `com.mycompany.web` package or by the `SomeCaller` class. Control flow pointcuts
are specified by using the `infra.aop.support.ControlFlowPointcut` class.

NOTE: Control flow pointcuts are significantly more expensive to evaluate at runtime than even
other dynamic pointcuts. In Java 1.4, the cost is about five times that of other dynamic
pointcuts.



[[aop-api-pointcuts-superclasses]]
== Pointcut Superclasses

Infra provides useful pointcut superclasses to help you to implement your own pointcuts.

Because static pointcuts are most useful, you should probably subclass
`StaticMethodMatcherPointcut`. This requires implementing only one
abstract method (although you can override other methods to customize behavior). The
following example shows how to subclass `StaticMethodMatcherPointcut`:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
class TestStaticPointcut extends StaticMethodMatcherPointcut {

  public boolean matches(Method m, Class targetClass) {
    // return true if custom criteria match
  }
}
----

======

There are also superclasses for dynamic pointcuts.
You can use custom pointcuts with any advice type.



[[aop-api-pointcuts-custom]]
== Custom Pointcuts

Because pointcuts in Infra AOP are Java classes rather than language features (as in
AspectJ), you can declare custom pointcuts, whether static or dynamic. Custom
pointcuts in Infra can be arbitrarily complex. However, we recommend using the AspectJ pointcut
expression language, if you can.

NOTE: Later versions of Infra may offer support for "`semantic pointcuts`" as offered by JAC --
for example, "`all methods that change instance variables in the target object.`"
