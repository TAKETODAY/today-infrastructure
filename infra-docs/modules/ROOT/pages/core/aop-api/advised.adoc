= Manipulating Advised Objects

However you create AOP proxies, you can manipulate them BY using the
`infra.aop.framework.Advised` interface. Any AOP proxy can be cast to this
interface, no matter which other interfaces it implements. This interface includes the
following methods:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
Advisor[] getAdvisors();

void addAdvice(Advice advice) throws AopConfigException;

void addAdvice(int pos, Advice advice) throws AopConfigException;

void addAdvisor(Advisor advisor) throws AopConfigException;

void addAdvisor(int pos, Advisor advisor) throws AopConfigException;

int indexOf(Advisor advisor);

boolean removeAdvisor(Advisor advisor) throws AopConfigException;

void removeAdvisor(int index) throws AopConfigException;

boolean replaceAdvisor(Advisor a, Advisor b) throws AopConfigException;

boolean isFrozen();
----

======

The `getAdvisors()` method returns an `Advisor` for every advisor, interceptor, or
other advice type that has been added to the factory. If you added an `Advisor`, the
returned advisor at this index is the object that you added. If you added an
interceptor or other advice type, Infra wrapped this in an advisor with a
pointcut that always returns `true`. Thus, if you added a `MethodInterceptor`, the advisor
returned for this index is a `DefaultPointcutAdvisor` that returns your
`MethodInterceptor` and a pointcut that matches all classes and methods.

The `addAdvisor()` methods can be used to add any `Advisor`. Usually, the advisor holding
pointcut and advice is the generic `DefaultPointcutAdvisor`, which you can use with
any advice or pointcut (but not for introductions).

By default, it is possible to add or remove advisors or interceptors even once a proxy
has been created. The only restriction is that it is impossible to add or remove an
introduction advisor, as existing proxies from the factory do not show the interface
change. (You can obtain a new proxy from the factory to avoid this problem.)

The following example shows casting an AOP proxy to the `Advised` interface and examining and
manipulating its advice:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	Advised advised = (Advised) myObject;
	Advisor[] advisors = advised.getAdvisors();
	int oldAdvisorCount = advisors.length;
	System.out.println(oldAdvisorCount + " advisors");

	// Add an advice like an interceptor without a pointcut
	// Will match all proxied methods
	// Can use for interceptors, before, after returning or throws advice
	advised.addAdvice(new DebugInterceptor());

	// Add selective advice using a pointcut
	advised.addAdvisor(new DefaultPointcutAdvisor(mySpecialPointcut, myAdvice));

	assertEquals("Added two advisors", oldAdvisorCount + 2, advised.getAdvisors().length);
----

======

NOTE: It is questionable whether it is advisable (no pun intended) to modify advice on a
business object in production, although there are, no doubt, legitimate usage cases.
However, it can be very useful in development (for example, in tests). We have sometimes
found it very useful to be able to add test code in the form of an interceptor or other
advice, getting inside a method invocation that we want to test. (For example, the advice can
get inside a transaction created for that method, perhaps to run SQL to check that
a database was correctly updated, before marking the transaction for roll back.)

Depending on how you created the proxy, you can usually set a `frozen` flag. In that
case, the `Advised` `isFrozen()` method returns `true`, and any attempts to modify
advice through addition or removal results in an `AopConfigException`. The ability
to freeze the state of an advised object is useful in some cases (for example, to
prevent calling code removing a security interceptor).
