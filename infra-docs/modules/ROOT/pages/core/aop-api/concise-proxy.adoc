= Concise Proxy Definitions

Especially when defining transactional proxies, you may end up with many similar proxy
definitions. The use of parent and child bean definitions, along with inner bean
definitions, can result in much cleaner and more concise proxy definitions.

First, we create a parent, template, bean definition for the proxy, as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="txProxyTemplate" abstract="true"
    class="infra.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="transactionManager" ref="transactionManager"/>
  <property name="transactionAttributes">
    <props>
      <prop key="*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
    </props>
  </property>
</bean>
----

This is never instantiated itself, so it can actually be incomplete. Then, each proxy
that needs to be created is a child bean definition, which wraps the target of the
proxy as an inner bean definition, since the target is never used on its own anyway.
The following example shows such a child bean:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="myService" parent="txProxyTemplate">
  <property name="target">
    <bean class="infra.samples.MyServiceImpl">
    </bean>
  </property>
</bean>
----

You can override properties from the parent template. In the following example,
we override the transaction propagation settings:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="mySpecialService" parent="txProxyTemplate">
  <property name="target">
    <bean class="infra.samples.MySpecialServiceImpl">
    </bean>
  </property>
  <property name="transactionAttributes">
    <props>
      <prop key="get*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly</prop>
      <prop key="find*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly</prop>
      <prop key="load*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly</prop>
      <prop key="store*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
    </props>
  </property>
</bean>
----

Note that in the parent bean example, we explicitly marked the parent bean definition as
being abstract by setting the `abstract` attribute to `true`, as described
xref:core/beans/child-bean-definitions.adoc[previously], so that it may not actually ever be
instantiated. Application contexts (but not simple bean factories), by default,
pre-instantiate all singletons. Therefore, it is important (at least for singleton beans)
that, if you have a (parent) bean definition that you intend to use only as a template,
and this definition specifies a class, you must make sure to set the `abstract`
attribute to `true`. Otherwise, the application context actually tries to
pre-instantiate it.
