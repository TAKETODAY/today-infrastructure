= Using the "auto-proxy" facility

So far, we have considered explicit creation of AOP proxies by using a `ProxyFactoryBean` or
similar factory bean.

Infra also lets us use "`auto-proxy`" bean definitions, which can automatically
proxy selected bean definitions. This is built on Infra "`bean post processor`"
infrastructure, which enables modification of any bean definition as the container loads.

In this model, you set up some special bean definitions in your XML bean definition file
to configure the auto-proxy infrastructure. This lets you declare the targets
eligible for auto-proxying. You need not use `ProxyFactoryBean`.

There are two ways to do this:

* By using an auto-proxy creator that refers to specific beans in the current context.
* A special case of auto-proxy creation that deserves to be considered separately:
  auto-proxy creation driven by source-level metadata attributes.

== Auto-proxy Bean Definitions

This section covers the  auto-proxy creators provided by the
`cn.taketoday.aop.framework.autoproxy` package.


[[aop-api-autoproxy]]
=== `BeanNameAutoProxyCreator`

The `BeanNameAutoProxyCreator` class is a `BeanPostProcessor` that automatically creates
AOP proxies for beans with names that match literal values or wildcards. The following
example shows how to create a `BeanNameAutoProxyCreator` bean:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean class="cn.taketoday.aop.framework.autoproxy.BeanNameAutoProxyCreator">
  <property name="beanNames" value="jdk*,onlyJdk"/>
  <property name="interceptorNames">
    <list>
      <value>myInterceptor</value>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>
----

As with `ProxyFactoryBean`, there is an `interceptorNames` property rather than a list
of interceptors, to allow correct behavior for prototype advisors. Named "`interceptors`"
can be advisors or any advice type.

As with auto-proxying in general, the main point of using `BeanNameAutoProxyCreator` is
to apply the same configuration consistently to multiple objects, with minimal volume of
configuration. It is a popular choice for applying declarative transactions to multiple
objects.

Bean definitions whose names match, such as `jdkMyBean` and `onlyJdk` in the preceding
example, are plain old bean definitions with the target class. An AOP proxy is
automatically created by the `BeanNameAutoProxyCreator`. The same advice is applied
to all matching beans. Note that, if advisors are used (rather than the interceptor in
the preceding example), the pointcuts may apply differently to different beans.


[[aop-api-autoproxy-default]]
=== `DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator`

A more general and extremely powerful auto-proxy creator is
`DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator`. This automagically applies eligible advisors in the
current context, without the need to include specific bean names in the auto-proxy
advisor's bean definition. It offers the same merit of consistent configuration and
avoidance of duplication as `BeanNameAutoProxyCreator`.

Using this mechanism involves:

* Specifying a `DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator` bean definition.
* Specifying any number of advisors in the same or related contexts. Note that these
  must be advisors, not interceptors or other advice. This is necessary,
  because there must be a pointcut to evaluate, to check the eligibility of each advice
  to candidate bean definitions.

The `DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator` automatically evaluates the pointcut contained
in each advisor, to see what (if any) advice it should apply to each business object
(such as `businessObject1` and `businessObject2` in the example).

This means that any number of advisors can be applied automatically to each business
object. If no pointcut in any of the advisors matches any method in a business object,
the object is not proxied. As bean definitions are added for new business objects,
they are automatically proxied if necessary.

Auto-proxying in general has the advantage of making it impossible for callers or
dependencies to obtain an un-advised object. Calling `getBean("businessObject1")` on this
`ApplicationContext` returns an AOP proxy, not the target business object. (The "`inner
bean`" idiom shown earlier also offers this benefit.)

The following example creates a `DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator` bean and the other
elements discussed in this section:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean class="cn.taketoday.aop.framework.autoproxy.DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator"/>

<bean class="cn.taketoday.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAttributeSourceAdvisor">
  <property name="transactionInterceptor" ref="transactionInterceptor"/>
</bean>

<bean id="customAdvisor" class="com.mycompany.MyAdvisor"/>

<bean id="businessObject1" class="com.mycompany.BusinessObject1">
  <!-- Properties omitted -->
</bean>

<bean id="businessObject2" class="com.mycompany.BusinessObject2"/>
----

The `DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator` is very useful if you want to apply the same advice
consistently to many business objects. Once the infrastructure definitions are in place,
you can add new business objects without including specific proxy configuration.
You can also easily drop in additional aspects (for example, tracing or
performance monitoring aspects) with minimal change to configuration.

The `DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator` offers support for filtering (by using a naming
convention so that only certain advisors are evaluated, which allows the use of multiple,
differently configured, AdvisorAutoProxyCreators in the same factory) and ordering.
Advisors can implement the `cn.taketoday.core.Ordered` interface to ensure
correct ordering if this is an issue. The `TransactionAttributeSourceAdvisor` used in the
preceding example has a configurable order value. The default setting is unordered.
