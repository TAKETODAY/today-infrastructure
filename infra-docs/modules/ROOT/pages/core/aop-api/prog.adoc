= Creating AOP Proxies Programmatically with the `ProxyFactory`

It is easy to create AOP proxies programmatically with Spring. This lets you use
Infra AOP without dependency on Infra IoC.

The interfaces implemented by the target object are
automatically proxied. The following listing shows creation of a proxy for a target object, with one
interceptor and one advisor:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
ProxyFactory factory = new ProxyFactory(myBusinessInterfaceImpl);
factory.addAdvice(myMethodInterceptor);
factory.addAdvisor(myAdvisor);
MyBusinessInterface tb = (MyBusinessInterface) factory.getProxy();
----

======

The first step is to construct an object of type
`cn.taketoday.aop.framework.ProxyFactory`. You can create this with a target
object, as in the preceding example, or specify the interfaces to be proxied in an alternate
constructor.

You can add advice (with interceptors as a specialized kind of advice), advisors, or both
and manipulate them for the life of the `ProxyFactory`. If you add an
`IntroductionInterceptionAroundAdvisor`, you can cause the proxy to implement additional
interfaces.

There are also convenience methods on `ProxyFactory` (inherited from `AdvisedSupport`)
that let you add other advice types, such as before and throws advice.
`AdvisedSupport` is the superclass of both `ProxyFactory` and `ProxyFactoryBean`.

TIP: Integrating AOP proxy creation with the IoC framework is best practice in most
applications. We recommend that you externalize configuration from Java code with AOP,
as you should in general.
