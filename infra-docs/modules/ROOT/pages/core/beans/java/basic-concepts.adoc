= Basic Concepts: `@Bean` and `@Configuration`

The central artifacts in Infra Java configuration support are
`@Configuration`-annotated classes and `@Bean`-annotated methods.

The `@Bean` annotation is used to indicate that a method instantiates, configures, and
initializes a new object to be managed by the Infra IoC container. For those familiar
with Infra `<beans/>` XML configuration, the `@Bean` annotation plays the same role as
the `<bean/>` element. You can use `@Bean`-annotated methods with any Infra
`@Component`. However, they are most often used with `@Configuration` beans.

Annotating a class with `@Configuration` indicates that its primary purpose is as a
source of bean definitions. Furthermore, `@Configuration` classes let inter-bean
dependencies be defined by calling other `@Bean` methods in the same class.
The simplest possible `@Configuration` class reads as follows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean
  public MyServiceImpl myService() {
    return new MyServiceImpl();
  }
}
----

======

The preceding `AppConfig` class is equivalent to the following Infra `<beans/>` XML:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans>
  <bean id="myService" class="com.acme.services.MyServiceImpl"/>
</beans>
----

.Full @Configuration vs "`lite`" @Bean mode?
****
When `@Bean` methods are declared within classes that are not annotated with
`@Configuration`, they are referred to as being processed in a "`lite`" mode. Bean methods
declared on a bean that is not annotated with `@Configuration` are considered to be "`lite`",
with a different primary purpose of the containing class and a `@Bean` method
being a sort of bonus there. For example, service components may expose management views
to the container through an additional `@Bean` method on each applicable component class.
In such scenarios, `@Bean` methods are a general-purpose factory method mechanism.

Unlike full `@Configuration`, lite `@Bean` methods cannot declare inter-bean dependencies.
Instead, they operate on their containing component's internal state and, optionally, on
arguments that they may declare. Such a `@Bean` method should therefore not invoke other
`@Bean` methods. Each such method is literally only a factory method for a particular
bean reference, without any special runtime semantics. The positive side-effect here is
that no CGLIB subclassing has to be applied at runtime, so there are no limitations in
terms of class design (that is, the containing class may be `final` and so forth).

In common scenarios, `@Bean` methods are to be declared within `@Configuration` classes,
ensuring that "`full`" mode is always used and that cross-method references therefore
get redirected to the container's lifecycle management. This prevents the same
`@Bean` method from accidentally being invoked through a regular Java call, which helps
to reduce subtle bugs that can be hard to track down when operating in "`lite`" mode.

The `@Bean` and `@Configuration` annotations are discussed in depth in the following sections.
First, however, we cover the various ways of creating a Infra container by using
Java-based configuration.
