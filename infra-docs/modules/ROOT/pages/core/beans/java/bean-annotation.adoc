[[beans-java-bean-annotation]]
= Using the `@Bean` Annotation

`@Bean` is a method-level annotation and a direct analog of the XML `<bean/>` element.
The annotation supports some of the attributes offered by `<bean/>`, such as:

* xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc#beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean[init-method]
* xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc#beans-factory-lifecycle-disposablebean[destroy-method]
* xref:core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.adoc[autowiring]
* `name`.

You can use the `@Bean` annotation in a `@Configuration`-annotated or in a
`@Component`-annotated class.


[[beans-java-declaring-a-bean]]
== Declaring a Bean

To declare a bean, you can annotate a method with the `@Bean` annotation. You use this
method to register a bean definition within an `ApplicationContext` of the type
specified as the method's return value. By default, the bean name is the same as
the method name. The following example shows a `@Bean` method declaration:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean
  public TransferServiceImpl transferService() {
    return new TransferServiceImpl();
  }
}
----

======

The preceding configuration is exactly equivalent to the following Infra XML:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans>
  <bean id="transferService" class="com.acme.TransferServiceImpl"/>
</beans>
----

Both declarations make a bean named `transferService` available in the
`ApplicationContext`, bound to an object instance of type `TransferServiceImpl`, as the
following text image shows:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
transferService -> com.acme.TransferServiceImpl
----

You can also use default methods to define beans. This allows composition of bean
configurations by implementing interfaces with bean definitions on default methods.

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public interface BaseConfig {

  @Bean
  default TransferServiceImpl transferService() {
    return new TransferServiceImpl();
  }
}

@Configuration
public class AppConfig implements BaseConfig {

}
----
======

You can also declare your `@Bean` method with an interface (or base class)
return type, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean
  public TransferService transferService() {
    return new TransferServiceImpl();
  }
}
----

======

However, this limits the visibility for advance type prediction to the specified
interface type (`TransferService`). Then, with the full type (`TransferServiceImpl`)
known to the container only once the affected singleton bean has been instantiated.
Non-lazy singleton beans get instantiated according to their declaration order,
so you may see different type matching results depending on when another component
tries to match by a non-declared type (such as `@Autowired TransferServiceImpl`,
which resolves only once the `transferService` bean has been instantiated).

TIP: If you consistently refer to your types by a declared service interface, your
`@Bean` return types may safely join that design decision. However, for components
that implement several interfaces or for components potentially referred to by their
implementation type, it is safer to declare the most specific return type possible
(at least as specific as required by the injection points that refer to your bean).


[[beans-java-dependencies]]
== Bean Dependencies

A `@Bean`-annotated method can have an arbitrary number of parameters that describe the
dependencies required to build that bean. For instance, if our `TransferService`
requires an `AccountRepository`, we can materialize that dependency with a method
parameter, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean
  public TransferService transferService(AccountRepository accountRepository) {
    return new TransferServiceImpl(accountRepository);
  }
}
----

======

The resolution mechanism is pretty much identical to constructor-based dependency
injection. See
xref:core/beans/dependencies/factory-collaborators.adoc#beans-constructor-injection[the relevant section]
for more details.


[[beans-java-lifecycle-callbacks]]
== Receiving Lifecycle Callbacks

Any classes defined with the `@Bean` annotation support the regular lifecycle callbacks
and can use the `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations from JSR-250. See
xref:core/beans/annotation-config/postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations.adoc[JSR-250 annotations] for further
details.

The regular Infra xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc[lifecycle] callbacks are fully supported as
well. If a bean implements `InitializingBean`, `DisposableBean`, or `Lifecycle`, their
respective methods are called by the container.

The standard set of `*Aware` interfaces (such as xref:core/beans/beanfactory.adoc[BeanFactoryAware],
xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc#beans-factory-aware[BeanNameAware],
xref:core/beans/context-introduction.adoc#context-functionality-messagesource[MessageSourceAware],
xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc#beans-factory-aware[ApplicationContextAware], and so on) are also fully supported.

The `@Bean` annotation supports specifying arbitrary initialization and destruction
callback methods, much like Infra XML's `init-method` and `destroy-method` attributes
on the `bean` element, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class BeanOne {

  public void init() {
    // initialization logic
  }
}

public class BeanTwo {

  public void cleanup() {
    // destruction logic
  }
}

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean(initMethod = "init")
  public BeanOne beanOne() {
    return new BeanOne();
  }

  @Bean(destroyMethod = "cleanup")
  public BeanTwo beanTwo() {
    return new BeanTwo();
  }
}
----

======

[NOTE]
=====
By default, beans defined with Java configuration that have a public `close` or `shutdown`
method are automatically enlisted with a destruction callback. If you have a public
`close` or `shutdown` method and you do not wish for it to be called when the container
shuts down, you can add `@Bean(destroyMethod = "")` to your bean definition to disable the
default `(inferred)` mode.

You may want to do that by default for a resource that you acquire with JNDI, as its
lifecycle is managed outside the application. In particular, make sure to always do it
for a `DataSource`, as it is known to be problematic on Jakarta EE application servers.

The following example shows how to prevent an automatic destruction callback for a
`DataSource`:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Bean(destroyMethod = "")
public DataSource dataSource() throws NamingException {
  return (DataSource) jndiTemplate.lookup("MyDS");
}
----

======

Also, with `@Bean` methods, you typically use programmatic JNDI lookups, either by
using Infra `JndiTemplate` or `JndiLocatorDelegate` helpers or straight JNDI
`InitialContext` usage but not the `JndiObjectFactoryBean` variant (which would force
you to declare the return type as the `FactoryBean` type instead of the actual target
type, making it harder to use for cross-reference calls in other `@Bean` methods that
intend to refer to the provided resource here).
=====

In the case of `BeanOne` from the example above the preceding note, it would be
equally valid to call the `init()` method directly during construction, as the
following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean
  public BeanOne beanOne() {
    BeanOne beanOne = new BeanOne();
    beanOne.init();
    return beanOne;
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

TIP: When you work directly in Java, you can do anything you like with your objects and do
not always need to rely on the container lifecycle.


[[beans-java-specifying-bean-scope]]
== Specifying Bean Scope

Infra includes the `@Scope` annotation so that you can specify the scope of a bean.

[[beans-java-available-scopes]]
=== Using the `@Scope` Annotation

You can specify that your beans defined with the `@Bean` annotation should have a
specific scope. You can use any of the standard scopes specified in the
xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc[Bean Scopes] section.

The default scope is `singleton`, but you can override this with the `@Scope` annotation,
as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

  @Bean
  @Scope("prototype")
  public Encryptor encryptor() {
    // ...
  }
}
----

======

[[beans-java-scoped-proxy]]
=== `@Scope` and `scoped-proxy`

Infra offers a convenient way of working with scoped dependencies through
xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc#beans-factory-scopes-other-injection[scoped proxies]. The easiest way to create
such a proxy when using the XML configuration is the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element.
Configuring your beans in Java with a `@Scope` annotation offers equivalent support
with the `proxyMode` attribute. The default is `ScopedProxyMode.DEFAULT`, which
typically indicates that no scoped proxy should be created unless a different default
has been configured at the component-scan instruction level. You can specify
`ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS`, `ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES` or `ScopedProxyMode.NO`.

If you port the scoped proxy example from the XML reference documentation (see
xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc#beans-factory-scopes-other-injection[scoped proxies]) to our `@Bean` using Java,
it resembles the following:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
// an HTTP Session-scoped bean exposed as a proxy
@Bean
@SessionScope
public UserPreferences userPreferences() {
  return new UserPreferences();
}

@Bean
public Service userService() {
  UserService service = new SimpleUserService();
  // a reference to the proxied userPreferences bean
  service.setUserPreferences(userPreferences());
  return service;
}
----

======

[[beans-java-customizing-bean-naming]]
== Customizing Bean Naming

By default, configuration classes use a `@Bean` method's name as the name of the
resulting bean. This functionality can be overridden, however, with the `name` attribute,
as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean("myThing")
  public Thing thing() {
    return new Thing();
  }
}
----

======


[[beans-java-bean-aliasing]]
== Bean Aliasing

As discussed in xref:core/beans/definition.adoc#beans-beanname[Naming Beans], it is
sometimes desirable to give a single bean multiple names, otherwise known as bean aliasing.
The `name` attribute of the `@Bean` annotation accepts a String array for this purpose.
The following example shows how to set a number of aliases for a bean:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean({"dataSource", "subsystemA-dataSource", "subsystemB-dataSource"})
  public DataSource dataSource() {
    // instantiate, configure and return DataSource bean...
  }
}
----

======


[[beans-java-bean-description]]
== Bean Description

Sometimes, it is helpful to provide a more detailed textual description of a bean. This can
be particularly useful when beans are exposed (perhaps through JMX) for monitoring purposes.

To add a description to a `@Bean`, you can use the
{today-framework-api}/context/annotation/Description.html[`@Description`]
annotation, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean
  @Description("Provides a basic example of a bean")
  public Thing thing() {
    return new Thing();
  }
}
----

======
