= Using the `@Configuration` annotation

`@Configuration` is a class-level annotation indicating that an object is a source of
bean definitions. `@Configuration` classes declare beans through `@Bean`-annotated
methods. Calls to `@Bean` methods on `@Configuration` classes can also be used to define
inter-bean dependencies. See xref:core/beans/java/basic-concepts.adoc[Basic Concepts: `@Bean` and `@Configuration`] for a general introduction.

== Injecting Inter-bean Dependencies

When beans have dependencies on one another, expressing that dependency is as simple
as having one bean method call another, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean
  public BeanOne beanOne() {
    return new BeanOne(beanTwo());
  }

  @Bean
  public BeanTwo beanTwo() {
    return new BeanTwo();
  }
}
----

======

In the preceding example, `beanOne` receives a reference to `beanTwo` through constructor
injection.

NOTE: This method of declaring inter-bean dependencies works only when the `@Bean` method
is declared within a `@Configuration` class. You cannot declare inter-bean dependencies
by using plain `@Component` classes.



[[beans-java-method-injection]]
== Lookup Method Injection

As noted earlier, xref:core/beans/dependencies/factory-method-injection.adoc[lookup method injection] is an
advanced feature that you should use rarely. It is useful in cases where a
singleton-scoped bean has a dependency on a prototype-scoped bean. Using Java for this
type of configuration provides a natural means for implementing this pattern. The
following example shows how to use lookup method injection:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public abstract class CommandManager {
  public Object process(Object commandState) {
    // grab a new instance of the appropriate Command interface
    Command command = createCommand();
    // set the state on the (hopefully brand new) Command instance
    command.setState(commandState);
    return command.execute();
  }

  // okay... but where is the implementation of this method?
  protected abstract Command createCommand();
}
----

======

By using Java configuration, you can create a subclass of `CommandManager` where
the abstract `createCommand()` method is overridden in such a way that it looks up a new
(prototype) command object. The following example shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public AsyncCommand asyncCommand() {
  AsyncCommand command = new AsyncCommand();
  // inject dependencies here as required
  return command;
}

@Bean
public CommandManager commandManager() {
  // return new anonymous implementation of CommandManager with createCommand()
  // overridden to return a new prototype Command object
  return new CommandManager() {
    protected Command createCommand() {
      return asyncCommand();
    }
  };

}
----

[[beans-java-further-information-java-config]]
== Further Information About How Java-based Configuration Works Internally

Consider the following example, which shows a `@Bean` annotated method being called twice:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean
  public ClientService clientService1() {
    ClientServiceImpl clientService = new ClientServiceImpl();
    clientService.setClientDao(clientDao());
    return clientService;
  }

  @Bean
  public ClientService clientService2() {
    ClientServiceImpl clientService = new ClientServiceImpl();
    clientService.setClientDao(clientDao());
    return clientService;
  }

  @Bean
  public ClientDao clientDao() {
    return new ClientDaoImpl();
  }
}
----

======

`clientDao()` has been called once in `clientService1()` and once in `clientService2()`.
Since this method creates a new instance of `ClientDaoImpl` and returns it, you would
normally expect to have two instances (one for each service). That definitely would be
problematic: In Infra, instantiated beans have a `singleton` scope by default. This is
where the magic comes in: All `@Configuration` classes are subclassed at startup-time
with `CGLIB`. In the subclass, the child method checks the container first for any
cached (scoped) beans before it calls the parent method and creates a new instance.

NOTE: The behavior could be different according to the scope of your bean. We are talking
about singletons here.

[NOTE]
====
It is not necessary to add CGLIB to your classpath because CGLIB classes are repackaged
under the `cn.taketoday.cglib` package and included directly within the
`today-core` JAR.
====

[TIP]
====
There are a few restrictions due to the fact that CGLIB dynamically adds features at
startup-time. In particular, configuration classes must not be final. However, any
constructors are allowed on configuration classes, including the use of `@Autowired` or a
single non-default constructor declaration for default injection.

If you prefer to avoid any CGLIB-imposed limitations, consider declaring your `@Bean`
methods on non-`@Configuration` classes (for example, on plain `@Component` classes
instead) or by annotating your configuration class with
`@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)`. Cross-method calls between `@Bean` methods
are then not intercepted, so you have to exclusively rely on dependency injection at the
constructor or method level there.
