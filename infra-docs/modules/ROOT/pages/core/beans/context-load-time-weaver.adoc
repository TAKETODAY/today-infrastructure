= Registering a `LoadTimeWeaver`

The `LoadTimeWeaver` is used by Infra to dynamically transform classes as they are
loaded into the Java virtual machine (JVM).

To enable load-time weaving, you can add the `@EnableLoadTimeWeaving` to one of your
`@Configuration` classes, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
@EnableLoadTimeWeaving
public class AppConfig {
}
----

======

Alternatively, for XML configuration, you can use the `context:load-time-weaver` element:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans>
  <context:load-time-weaver/>
</beans>
----

Once configured for the `ApplicationContext`, any bean within that `ApplicationContext`
may implement `LoadTimeWeaverAware`, thereby receiving a reference to the load-time
weaver instance. This is particularly useful in combination with
xref:data-access/orm/jpa.adoc[Infra JPA support] where load-time weaving may be
necessary for JPA class transformation.
Consult the
{today-framework-api}/orm/jpa/LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean.html[`LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean`]
javadoc for more detail. For more on AspectJ load-time weaving, see xref:core/aop/using-aspectj.adoc#aop-aj-ltw[Load-time Weaving with AspectJ in the TODAY Framework].
