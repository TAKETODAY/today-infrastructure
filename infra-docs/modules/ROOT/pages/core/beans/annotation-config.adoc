[[beans-annotation-config]]
= Annotation-based Container Configuration

.Are annotations better than XML for configuring Spring?
****
The introduction of annotation-based configuration raised the question of whether this
approach is "`better`" than XML. The short answer is "`it depends.`" The long answer is
that each approach has its pros and cons, and, usually, it is up to the developer to
decide which strategy suits them better. Due to the way they are defined, annotations
provide a lot of context in their declaration, leading to shorter and more concise
configuration. However, XML excels at wiring up components without touching their source
code or recompiling them. Some developers prefer having the wiring close to the source
while others argue that annotated classes are no longer POJOs and, furthermore, that the
configuration becomes decentralized and harder to control.

No matter the choice, Infra can accommodate both styles and even mix them together.
It is worth pointing out that through its xref:core/beans/java.adoc[JavaConfig] option, Infra lets
annotations be used in a non-invasive way, without touching the target components'
source code and that, in terms of tooling, all configuration styles are supported by
{today-tech-site-tools}[Infra Tools] for Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and Theia.

An alternative to XML setup is provided by annotation-based configuration, which relies
on bytecode metadata for wiring up components instead of XML declarations. Instead of
using XML to describe a bean wiring, the developer moves the configuration into the
component class itself by using annotations on the relevant class, method, or field
declaration. As mentioned in xref:core/beans/factory-extension.adoc#beans-factory-extension-bpp-examples-aabpp[Example: The `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`], using a
`BeanPostProcessor` in conjunction with annotations is a common means of extending the
Infra IoC container. For example, the xref:core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.adoc[`@Autowired`]
annotation provides the same capabilities as described in xref:core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.adoc[Autowiring Collaborators] but
with more fine-grained control and wider applicability. In addition, Infra provides
support for JSR-250 annotations, such as `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`, as well as
support for JSR-330 (Dependency Injection for Java) annotations contained in the
`jakarta.inject` package such as `@Inject` and `@Named`. Details about those annotations
can be found in the xref:core/beans/standard-annotations.adoc[relevant section].

[NOTE]
====
Annotation injection is performed before XML injection. Thus, the XML configuration
overrides the annotations for properties wired through both approaches.

As always, you can register the post-processors as individual bean definitions, but they
can also be implicitly registered by including the following tag in an XML-based Spring
configuration (notice the inclusion of the `context` namespace):

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

  <context:annotation-config/>

</beans>
----

The `<context:annotation-config/>` element implicitly registers the following post-processors:

* {today-framework-api}/context/annotation/ConfigurationClassPostProcessor.html[`ConfigurationClassPostProcessor`]
* {today-framework-api}/beans/factory/annotation/AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html[`AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`]
* {today-framework-api}/context/annotation/CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html[`CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`]
* {today-framework-api}/orm/jpa/support/PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html[`PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`]
* {today-framework-api}/context/event/EventListenerMethodProcessor.html[`EventListenerMethodProcessor`]

[NOTE]
====
`<context:annotation-config/>` only looks for annotations on beans in the same
application context in which it is defined. This means that, if you put
`<context:annotation-config/>` in a `WebApplicationContext` for a `DispatcherServlet`,
it only checks for `@Autowired` beans in your controllers, and not your services. See
xref:web/webmvc/mvc-servlet.adoc[The DispatcherServlet] for more information.
