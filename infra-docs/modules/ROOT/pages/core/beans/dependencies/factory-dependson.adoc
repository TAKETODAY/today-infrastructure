= Using `depends-on`

If a bean is a dependency of another bean, that usually means that one bean is set as a
property of another. Typically you accomplish this with the <<beans-ref-element, `<ref/>`
element>> in XML-based configuration metadata. However, sometimes dependencies between
beans are less direct. An example is when a static initializer in a class needs to be
triggered, such as for database driver registration. The `depends-on` attribute can
explicitly force one or more beans to be initialized before the bean using this element
is initialized. The following example uses the `depends-on` attribute to express a
dependency on a single bean:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="beanOne" class="ExampleBean" depends-on="manager"/>
<bean id="manager" class="ManagerBean" />
----

To express a dependency on multiple beans, supply a list of bean names as the value of
the `depends-on` attribute (commas, whitespace, and semicolons are valid
delimiters):

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="beanOne" class="ExampleBean" depends-on="manager,accountDao">
  <property name="manager" ref="manager" />
</bean>

<bean id="manager" class="ManagerBean" />
<bean id="accountDao" class="x.y.jdbc.JdbcAccountDao" />
----

NOTE: The `depends-on` attribute can specify both an initialization-time dependency and,
in the case of xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc#beans-factory-scopes-singleton[singleton] beans only, a corresponding
destruction-time dependency. Dependent beans that define a `depends-on` relationship
with a given bean are destroyed first, prior to the given bean itself being destroyed.
Thus, `depends-on` can also control shutdown order.
