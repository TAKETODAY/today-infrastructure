= Lazy-initialized Beans

By default, `ApplicationContext` implementations eagerly create and configure all
xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc#beans-factory-scopes-singleton[singleton] beans as part of the initialization
process. Generally, this pre-instantiation is desirable, because errors in the
configuration or surrounding environment are discovered immediately, as opposed to hours
or even days later. When this behavior is not desirable, you can prevent
pre-instantiation of a singleton bean by marking the bean definition as being
lazy-initialized. A lazy-initialized bean tells the IoC container to create a bean
instance when it is first requested, rather than at startup.

In XML, this behavior is controlled by the `lazy-init` attribute on the `<bean/>`
element, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="lazy" class="com.something.ExpensiveToCreateBean" lazy-init="true"/>
<bean name="not.lazy" class="com.something.AnotherBean"/>
----

When the preceding configuration is consumed by an `ApplicationContext`, the `lazy` bean
is not eagerly pre-instantiated when the `ApplicationContext` starts,
whereas the `not.lazy` bean is eagerly pre-instantiated.

However, when a lazy-initialized bean is a dependency of a singleton bean that is
not lazy-initialized, the `ApplicationContext` creates the lazy-initialized bean at
startup, because it must satisfy the singleton's dependencies. The lazy-initialized bean
is injected into a singleton bean elsewhere that is not lazy-initialized.

You can also control lazy-initialization at the container level by using the
`default-lazy-init` attribute on the `<beans/>` element, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans default-lazy-init="true">
  <!-- no beans will be pre-instantiated... -->
</beans>
----
