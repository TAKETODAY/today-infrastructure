[[beans-environment]]
= Environment Abstraction

The {today-framework-api}/core/env/Environment.html[`Environment`] interface
is an abstraction integrated in the container that models two key
aspects of the application environment: xref:core/beans/environment.adoc#beans-definition-profiles[profiles]
and xref:core/beans/environment.adoc#beans-property-source-abstraction[properties].

A profile is a named, logical group of bean definitions to be registered with the
container only if the given profile is active. Beans may be assigned to a profile
whether defined in XML or with annotations. The role of the `Environment` object with
relation to profiles is in determining which profiles (if any) are currently active,
and which profiles (if any) should be active by default.

Properties play an important role in almost all applications and may originate from
a variety of sources: properties files, JVM system properties, system environment
variables, JNDI, servlet context parameters, ad-hoc `Properties` objects, `Map` objects, and so
on. The role of the `Environment` object with relation to properties is to provide the
user with a convenient service interface for configuring property sources and resolving
properties from them.



[[beans-definition-profiles]]
== Bean Definition Profiles

Bean definition profiles provide a mechanism in the core container that allows for
registration of different beans in different environments. The word, "`environment,`"
can mean different things to different users, and this feature can help with many
use cases, including:

* Working against an in-memory datasource in development versus looking up that same
datasource from JNDI when in QA or production.
* Registering monitoring infrastructure only when deploying an application into a
performance environment.
* Registering customized implementations of beans for customer A versus customer
B deployments.

Consider the first use case in a practical application that requires a
`DataSource`. In a test environment, the configuration might resemble the following:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public DataSource dataSource() {
  return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()
    .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL)
    .addScript("my-schema.sql")
    .addScript("my-test-data.sql")
    .build();
}
----

======

Now consider how this application can be deployed into a QA or production
environment, assuming that the datasource for the application is registered
with the production application server's JNDI directory. Our `dataSource` bean
now looks like the following listing:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Bean(destroyMethod = "")
public DataSource dataSource() throws Exception {
  Context ctx = new InitialContext();
  return (DataSource) ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource");
}
----

======

The problem is how to switch between using these two variations based on the
current environment. Over time, Spring users have devised a number of ways to
get this done, usually relying on a combination of system environment variables
and XML `<import/>` statements containing pass:q[`${placeholder}`] tokens that resolve
to the correct configuration file path depending on the value of an environment
variable. Bean definition profiles is a core container feature that provides a
solution to this problem.

If we generalize the use case shown in the preceding example of environment-specific bean
definitions, we end up with the need to register certain bean definitions in
certain contexts but not in others. You could say that you want to register a
certain profile of bean definitions in situation A and a different profile in
situation B. We start by updating our configuration to reflect this need.


[[beans-definition-profiles-java]]
=== Using `@Profile`

The {today-framework-api}/context/annotation/Profile.html[`@Profile`]
annotation lets you indicate that a component is eligible for registration
when one or more specified profiles are active. Using our preceding example, we
can rewrite the `dataSource` configuration as follows:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
@Profile("development")
public class StandaloneDataConfig {

  @Bean
  public DataSource dataSource() {
    return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()
      .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL)
      .addScript("classpath:com/bank/config/sql/schema.sql")
      .addScript("classpath:com/bank/config/sql/test-data.sql")
      .build();
  }
}
----

======
--

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
@Profile("production")
public class JndiDataConfig {

  @Bean(destroyMethod = "") // <1>
  public DataSource dataSource() throws Exception {
    Context ctx = new InitialContext();
    return (DataSource) ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource");
  }
}
----
<1> `@Bean(destroyMethod = "")` disables default destroy method inference.

======
--

NOTE: As mentioned earlier, with `@Bean` methods, you typically choose to use programmatic
JNDI lookups, by using either Infra `JndiTemplate`/`JndiLocatorDelegate` helpers or the
straight JNDI `InitialContext` usage shown earlier but not the `JndiObjectFactoryBean`
variant, which would force you to declare the return type as the `FactoryBean` type.

The profile string may contain a simple profile name (for example, `production`) or a
profile expression. A profile expression allows for more complicated profile logic to be
expressed (for example, `production & us-east`). The following operators are supported in
profile expressions:

* `!`: A logical `NOT` of the profile
* `&`: A logical `AND` of the profiles
* `|`: A logical `OR` of the profiles

NOTE: You cannot mix the `&` and `|` operators without using parentheses. For example,
`production & us-east | eu-central` is not a valid expression. It must be expressed as
`production & (us-east | eu-central)`.

You can use `@Profile` as a xref:core/beans/classpath-scanning.adoc#beans-meta-annotations[meta-annotation] for the purpose
of creating a custom composed annotation. The following example defines a custom
`@Production` annotation that you can use as a drop-in replacement for
`@Profile("production")`:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Profile("production")
public @interface Production {
}
----

======
--

TIP: If a `@Configuration` class is marked with `@Profile`, all of the `@Bean` methods and
`@Import` annotations associated with that class are bypassed unless one or more of
the specified profiles are active. If a `@Component` or `@Configuration` class is marked
with `@Profile({"p1", "p2"})`, that class is not registered or processed unless
profiles 'p1' or 'p2' have been activated. If a given profile is prefixed with the
NOT operator (`!`), the annotated element is registered only if the profile is not
active. For example, given `@Profile({"p1", "!p2"})`, registration will occur if profile
'p1' is active or if profile 'p2' is not active.

`@Profile` can also be declared at the method level to include only one particular bean
of a configuration class (for example, for alternative variants of a particular bean), as
the following example shows:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

  @Bean("dataSource")
  @Profile("development") // <1>
  public DataSource standaloneDataSource() {
    return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()
      .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL)
      .addScript("classpath:com/bank/config/sql/schema.sql")
      .addScript("classpath:com/bank/config/sql/test-data.sql")
      .build();
  }

  @Bean("dataSource")
  @Profile("production") // <2>
  public DataSource jndiDataSource() throws Exception {
    Context ctx = new InitialContext();
    return (DataSource) ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource");
  }
}
----
<1> The `standaloneDataSource` method is available only in the `development` profile.
<2> The `jndiDataSource` method is available only in the `production` profile.

======
--

[NOTE]
====
With `@Profile` on `@Bean` methods, a special scenario may apply: In the case of
overloaded `@Bean` methods of the same Java method name (analogous to constructor
overloading), a `@Profile` condition needs to be consistently declared on all
overloaded methods. If the conditions are inconsistent, only the condition on the
first declaration among the overloaded methods matters. Therefore, `@Profile` can
not be used to select an overloaded method with a particular argument signature over
another. Resolution between all factory methods for the same bean follows Infra
constructor resolution algorithm at creation time.

If you want to define alternative beans with different profile conditions,
use distinct Java method names that point to the same bean name by using the `@Bean` name
attribute, as shown in the preceding example. If the argument signatures are all
the same (for example, all of the variants have no-arg factory methods), this is the only
way to represent such an arrangement in a valid Java class in the first place
(since there can only be one method of a particular name and argument signature).
====


[[beans-definition-profiles-xml]]
=== XML Bean Definition Profiles

The XML counterpart is the `profile` attribute of the `<beans>` element. Our preceding sample
configuration can be rewritten in two XML files, as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans profile="development"
  xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:jdbc="http://www.springframework.org/schema/jdbc"
  xsi:schemaLocation="...">

  <jdbc:embedded-database id="dataSource">
    <jdbc:script location="classpath:com/bank/config/sql/schema.sql"/>
    <jdbc:script location="classpath:com/bank/config/sql/test-data.sql"/>
  </jdbc:embedded-database>
</beans>
----

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans profile="production"
  xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:jee="http://www.springframework.org/schema/jee"
  xsi:schemaLocation="...">

  <jee:jndi-lookup id="dataSource" jndi-name="java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource"/>
</beans>
----

It is also possible to avoid that split and nest `<beans/>` elements within the same file,
as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:jdbc="http://www.springframework.org/schema/jdbc"
  xmlns:jee="http://www.springframework.org/schema/jee"
  xsi:schemaLocation="...">

  <!-- other bean definitions -->

  <beans profile="development">
    <jdbc:embedded-database id="dataSource">
      <jdbc:script location="classpath:com/bank/config/sql/schema.sql"/>
      <jdbc:script location="classpath:com/bank/config/sql/test-data.sql"/>
    </jdbc:embedded-database>
  </beans>

  <beans profile="production">
    <jee:jndi-lookup id="dataSource" jndi-name="java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource"/>
  </beans>
</beans>
----

The `spring-bean.xsd` has been constrained to allow such elements only as the
last ones in the file. This should help provide flexibility without incurring
clutter in the XML files.

[NOTE]
=====
The XML counterpart does not support the profile expressions described earlier. It is possible,
however, to negate a profile by using the `!` operator. It is also possible to apply a logical
"`and`" by nesting the profiles, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:jdbc="http://www.springframework.org/schema/jdbc"
  xmlns:jee="http://www.springframework.org/schema/jee"
  xsi:schemaLocation="...">

  <!-- other bean definitions -->

  <beans profile="production">
    <beans profile="us-east">
      <jee:jndi-lookup id="dataSource" jndi-name="java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource"/>
    </beans>
  </beans>
</beans>
----

In the preceding example, the `dataSource` bean is exposed if both the `production` and
`us-east` profiles are active.
=====


[[beans-definition-profiles-enable]]
=== Activating a Profile

Now that we have updated our configuration, we still need to instruct Spring which
profile is active. If we started our sample application right now, we would see
a `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` thrown, because the container could not find
the Spring bean named `dataSource`.

Activating a profile can be done in several ways, but the most straightforward is to do
it programmatically against the `Environment` API which is available through an
`ApplicationContext`. The following example shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
ctx.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles("development");
ctx.register(SomeConfig.class, StandaloneDataConfig.class, JndiDataConfig.class);
ctx.refresh();
----

======

In addition, you can also declaratively activate profiles through the
`infra.profiles.active` property, which may be specified through system environment
variables, JVM system properties, servlet context parameters in `web.xml`, or even as an
entry in JNDI (see xref:core/beans/environment.adoc#beans-property-source-abstraction[`PropertySource` Abstraction]). In integration tests, active
profiles can be declared by using the `@ActiveProfiles` annotation in the `today-test`
module (see xref:testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/env-profiles.adoc[context configuration with environment profiles]
).

Note that profiles are not an "`either-or`" proposition. You can activate multiple
profiles at once. Programmatically, you can provide multiple profile names to the
`setActiveProfiles()` method, which accepts `String...` varargs. The following example
activates multiple profiles:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
ctx.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles("profile1", "profile2");
----

======

Declaratively, `infra.profiles.active` may accept a comma-separated list of profile names,
as the following example shows:

[literal,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
-Dinfra.profiles.active="profile1,profile2"
----


[[beans-definition-profiles-default]]
=== Default Profile

The default profile represents the profile that is enabled if no profile is active. Consider
the following example:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
@Profile("default")
public class DefaultDataConfig {

  @Bean
  public DataSource dataSource() {
    return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()
      .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL)
      .addScript("classpath:com/bank/config/sql/schema.sql")
      .build();
  }
}
----
======

If xref:#beans-definition-profiles-enable[no profile is active], the `dataSource` is
created. You can see this as a way to provide a default definition for one or more
beans. If any profile is enabled, the default profile does not apply.

The name of the default profile is `default`. You can change the name of
the default profile by using `setDefaultProfiles()` on the `Environment` or,
declaratively, by using the `infra.profiles.default` property.



[[beans-property-source-abstraction]]
== `PropertySource` Abstraction

Infra `Environment` abstraction provides search operations over a configurable
hierarchy of property sources. Consider the following listing:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
ApplicationContext ctx = new GenericApplicationContext();
Environment env = ctx.getEnvironment();
boolean containsMyProperty = env.containsProperty("my-property");
System.out.println("Does my environment contain the 'my-property' property? " + containsMyProperty);
----

======

In the preceding snippet, we see a high-level way of asking Spring whether the `my-property` property is
defined for the current environment. To answer this question, the `Environment` object performs
a search over a set of {today-framework-api}/core/env/PropertySource.html[`PropertySource`]
objects. A `PropertySource` is a simple abstraction over any source of key-value pairs, and
Infra {today-framework-api}/core/env/StandardEnvironment.html[`StandardEnvironment`]
is configured with two PropertySource objects -- one representing the set of JVM system properties
(`System.getProperties()`) and one representing the set of system environment variables
(`System.getenv()`).

NOTE: These default property sources are present for `StandardEnvironment`, for use in standalone
applications. {today-framework-api}/web/context/support/StandardServletEnvironment.html[`StandardServletEnvironment`]
is populated with additional default property sources including servlet config, servlet
context parameters, and a {today-framework-api}/jndi/JndiPropertySource.html[`JndiPropertySource`]
if JNDI is available.

Concretely, when you use the `StandardEnvironment`, the call to `env.containsProperty("my-property")`
returns true if a `my-property` system property or `my-property` environment variable is present at
runtime.

[TIP]
====
The search performed is hierarchical. By default, system properties have precedence over
environment variables. So, if the `my-property` property happens to be set in both places during
a call to `env.getProperty("my-property")`, the system property value "`wins`" and is returned.
Note that property values are not merged
but rather completely overridden by a preceding entry.

For a common `StandardServletEnvironment`, the full hierarchy is as follows, with the
highest-precedence entries at the top:

. ServletConfig parameters (if applicable -- for example, in case of a `DispatcherServlet` context)
. ServletContext parameters (web.xml context-param entries)
. JNDI environment variables (`java:comp/env/` entries)
. JVM system properties (`-D` command-line arguments)
. JVM system environment (operating system environment variables)
====

Most importantly, the entire mechanism is configurable. Perhaps you have a custom source
of properties that you want to integrate into this search. To do so, implement
and instantiate your own `PropertySource` and add it to the set of `PropertySources` for the
current `Environment`. The following example shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
ConfigurableApplicationContext ctx = new GenericApplicationContext();
MutablePropertySources sources = ctx.getEnvironment().getPropertySources();
sources.addFirst(new MyPropertySource());
----

======

In the preceding code, `MyPropertySource` has been added with highest precedence in the
search. If it contains a  `my-property` property, the property is detected and returned, in favor of
any `my-property` property in any other `PropertySource`. The
{today-framework-api}/core/env/MutablePropertySources.html[`MutablePropertySources`]
API exposes a number of methods that allow for precise manipulation of the set of
property sources.



[[beans-using-propertysource]]
== Using `@PropertySource`

The {today-framework-api}/context/annotation/PropertySource.html[`@PropertySource`]
annotation provides a convenient and declarative mechanism for adding a `PropertySource`
to Infra `Environment`.

Given a file called `app.properties` that contains the key-value pair `testbean.name=myTestBean`,
the following `@Configuration` class uses `@PropertySource` in such a way that
a call to `testBean.getName()` returns `myTestBean`:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
 @Configuration
 @PropertySource("classpath:/com/myco/app.properties")
 public class AppConfig {

   @Autowired
   Environment env;

   @Bean
   public TestBean testBean() {
     TestBean testBean = new TestBean();
     testBean.setName(env.getProperty("testbean.name"));
     return testBean;
   }
 }
----

======

Any `${...}` placeholders present in a `@PropertySource` resource location are
resolved against the set of property sources already registered against the
environment, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
 @Configuration
 @PropertySource("classpath:/com/${my.placeholder:default/path}/app.properties")
 public class AppConfig {

   @Autowired
   Environment env;

   @Bean
   public TestBean testBean() {
     TestBean testBean = new TestBean();
     testBean.setName(env.getProperty("testbean.name"));
     return testBean;
   }
 }
----

======

Assuming that `my.placeholder` is present in one of the property sources already
registered (for example, system properties or environment variables), the placeholder is
resolved to the corresponding value. If not, then `default/path` is used
as a default. If no default is specified and a property cannot be resolved, an
`IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

NOTE: `@PropertySource` can be used as a repeatable annotation. `@PropertySource`
may also be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations with
attribute overrides.



[[beans-placeholder-resolution-in-statements]]
== Placeholder Resolution in Statements

Historically, the value of placeholders in elements could be resolved only against
JVM system properties or environment variables. This is no longer the case. Because
the `Environment` abstraction is integrated throughout the container, it is easy to
route resolution of placeholders through it. This means that you may configure the
resolution process in any way you like. You can change the precedence of searching through
system properties and environment variables or remove them entirely. You can also add your
own property sources to the mix, as appropriate.

Concretely, the following statement works regardless of where the `customer`
property is defined, as long as it is available in the `Environment`:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<beans>
  <import resource="com/bank/service/${customer}-config.xml"/>
</beans>
----
