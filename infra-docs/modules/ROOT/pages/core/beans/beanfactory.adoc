= The `BeanFactory` API

The `BeanFactory` API provides the underlying basis for Spring's IoC functionality.
Its specific contracts are mostly used in integration with other parts of Spring and
related third-party frameworks, and its `DefaultListableBeanFactory` implementation
is a key delegate within the higher-level `GenericApplicationContext` container.

`BeanFactory` and related interfaces (such as `BeanFactoryAware`, `InitializingBean`,
`DisposableBean`) are important integration points for other framework components.
By not requiring any annotations or even reflection, they allow for very efficient
interaction between the container and its components. Application-level beans may
use the same callback interfaces but typically prefer declarative dependency
injection instead, either through annotations or through programmatic configuration.

Note that the core `BeanFactory` API level and its `DefaultListableBeanFactory`
implementation do not make assumptions about the configuration format or any
component annotations to be used. All of these flavors come in through extensions
(such as `XmlBeanDefinitionReader` and `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`) and
operate on shared `BeanDefinition` objects as a core metadata representation.
This is the essence of what makes Spring's container so flexible and extensible.

== `BeanFactory` or `ApplicationContext`?

This section explains the differences between the `BeanFactory` and
`ApplicationContext` container levels and the implications on bootstrapping.

You should use an `ApplicationContext` unless you have a good reason for not doing so, with
`GenericApplicationContext` and its subclass `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`
as the common implementations for custom bootstrapping. These are the primary entry
points to Spring's core container for all common purposes: loading of configuration
files, triggering a classpath scan, programmatically registering bean definitions
and annotated classes, and (as of 5.0) registering functional bean definitions.

Because an `ApplicationContext` includes all the functionality of a `BeanFactory`, it is
generally recommended over a plain `BeanFactory`, except for scenarios where full
control over bean processing is needed. Within an `ApplicationContext` (such as the
`GenericApplicationContext` implementation), several kinds of beans are detected
by convention (that is, by bean name or by bean type -- in particular, post-processors),
while a plain `DefaultListableBeanFactory` is agnostic about any special beans.

For many extended container features, such as annotation processing and AOP proxying,
the xref:core/beans/factory-extension.adoc#beans-factory-extension-bpp[`BeanPostProcessor` extension point] is essential.
If you use only a plain `DefaultListableBeanFactory`, such post-processors do not
get detected and activated by default. This situation could be confusing, because
nothing is actually wrong with your bean configuration. Rather,  in such a scenario,
the container needs to be fully bootstrapped through additional setup.

The following table lists features provided by the `BeanFactory` and
`ApplicationContext` interfaces and implementations.

|===

To explicitly register a bean post-processor with a `DefaultListableBeanFactory`,
you need to programmatically call `addBeanPostProcessor`, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
DefaultListableBeanFactory factory = new DefaultListableBeanFactory();
// populate the factory with bean definitions

// now register any needed BeanPostProcessor instances
factory.addBeanPostProcessor(new AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor());
factory.addBeanPostProcessor(new MyBeanPostProcessor());

// now start using the factory
----

======

To apply a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` to a plain `DefaultListableBeanFactory`,
you need to call its `postProcessBeanFactory` method, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
DefaultListableBeanFactory factory = new DefaultListableBeanFactory();
XmlBeanDefinitionReader reader = new XmlBeanDefinitionReader(factory);
reader.loadBeanDefinitions(new FileSystemResource("beans.xml"));

// bring in some property values from a Properties file
PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer cfg = new PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer();
cfg.setLocation(new FileSystemResource("jdbc.properties"));

// now actually do the replacement
cfg.postProcessBeanFactory(factory);
----

======

In both cases, the explicit registration steps are inconvenient, which is
why the various `ApplicationContext` variants are preferred over a plain
`DefaultListableBeanFactory` in Spring-backed applications, especially when
relying on `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` and `BeanPostProcessor` instances for extended
container functionality in a typical enterprise setup.

[NOTE]
====
An `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` has all common annotation post-processors
registered and may bring in additional processors underneath the
covers through configuration annotations, such as `@EnableTransactionManagement`.
At the abstraction level of Spring's annotation-based configuration model,
the notion of bean post-processors becomes a mere internal container detail.
