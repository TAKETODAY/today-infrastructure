= Bean Definition Inheritance

A bean definition can contain a lot of configuration information, including constructor
arguments, property values, and container-specific information, such as the initialization
method, a static factory method name, and so on. A child bean definition inherits
configuration data from a parent definition. The child definition can override some
values or add others as needed. Using parent and child bean definitions can save a lot
of typing. Effectively, this is a form of templating.

If you work with an `ApplicationContext` interface programmatically, child bean
definitions are represented by the `ChildBeanDefinition` class. Most users do not work
with them on this level. Instead, they configure bean definitions declaratively in a class
such as the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`. When you use XML-based configuration
metadata, you can indicate a child bean definition by using the `parent` attribute,
specifying the parent bean as the value of this attribute. The following example shows how
to do so:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="inheritedTestBean" abstract="true" class="cn.taketoday.beans.TestBean">
  <property name="name" value="parent"/>
  <property name="age" value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="inheritsWithDifferentClass" class="cn.taketoday.beans.DerivedTestBean"
    parent="inheritedTestBean" init-method="initialize">  <1>
  <property name="name" value="override"/>
  <!-- the age property value of 1 will be inherited from parent -->
</bean>
----
<1> Note the `parent` attribute.

A child bean definition uses the bean class from the parent definition if none is
specified but can also override it. In the latter case, the child bean class must be
compatible with the parent (that is, it must accept the parent's property values).

A child bean definition inherits scope, constructor argument values, property values, and
method overrides from the parent, with the option to add new values. Any scope, initialization
method, destroy method, or `static` factory method settings that you specify
override the corresponding parent settings.

The remaining settings are always taken from the child definition: depends on,
autowire mode, dependency check, singleton, and lazy init.

The preceding example explicitly marks the parent bean definition as abstract by using
the `abstract` attribute. If the parent definition does not specify a class, explicitly
marking the parent bean definition as `abstract` is required, as the following example
shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="inheritedTestBeanWithoutClass" abstract="true">
  <property name="name" value="parent"/>
  <property name="age" value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="inheritsWithClass" class="cn.taketoday.beans.DerivedTestBean"
    parent="inheritedTestBeanWithoutClass" init-method="initialize">
  <property name="name" value="override"/>
  <!-- age will inherit the value of 1 from the parent bean definition-->
</bean>
----

The parent bean cannot be instantiated on its own because it is incomplete, and it is
also explicitly marked as `abstract`. When a definition is `abstract`, it is
usable only as a pure template bean definition that serves as a parent definition for
child definitions. Trying to use such an `abstract` parent bean on its own, by referring
to it as a ref property of another bean or doing an explicit `getBean()` call with the
parent bean ID returns an error. Similarly, the container's internal
`preInstantiateSingletons()` method ignores bean definitions that are defined as
abstract.

NOTE: `ApplicationContext` pre-instantiates all singletons by default. Therefore, it is
important (at least for singleton beans) that if you have a (parent) bean definition
which you intend to use only as a template, and this definition specifies a class, you
must make sure to set the __abstract__ attribute to __true__, otherwise the application
context will actually (attempt to) pre-instantiate the `abstract` bean.
