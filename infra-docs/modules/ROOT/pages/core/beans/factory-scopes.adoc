= Bean Scopes

When you create a bean definition, you create a recipe for creating actual instances
of the class defined by that bean definition. The idea that a bean definition is a
recipe is important, because it means that, as with a class, you can create many object
instances from a single recipe.

You can control not only the various dependencies and configuration values that are to
be plugged into an object that is created from a particular bean definition but also control
the scope of the objects created from a particular bean definition. This approach is
powerful and flexible, because you can choose the scope of the objects you create
through configuration instead of having to bake in the scope of an object at the Java
class level. Beans can be defined to be deployed in one of a number of scopes.
The TODAY Framework supports six scopes, four of which are available only if
you use a web-aware `ApplicationContext`. You can also create
xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc#beans-factory-scopes-custom[a custom scope.]

The following table describes the supported scopes:

[[beans-factory-scopes-singleton]]
== The Singleton Scope

Only one shared instance of a singleton bean is managed, and all requests for beans
with an ID or IDs that match that bean definition result in that one specific bean
instance being returned by the Infra container.

To put it another way, when you define a bean definition and it is scoped as a
singleton, the Infra IoC container creates exactly one instance of the object
defined by that bean definition. This single instance is stored in a cache of such
singleton beans, and all subsequent requests and references for that named bean
return the cached object. The following image shows how the singleton scope works:

image::singleton.png[]

Infra concept of a singleton bean differs from the singleton pattern as defined in
the Gang of Four (GoF) patterns book. The GoF singleton hard-codes the scope of an
object such that one and only one instance of a particular class is created per
ClassLoader. The scope of the Infra singleton is best described as being per-container
and per-bean. This means that, if you define one bean for a particular class in a
single Infra container, the Infra container creates one and only one instance
of the class defined by that bean definition. The singleton scope is the default scope
in Infra. To define a bean as a singleton in XML, you can define a bean as shown in the
following example:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="accountService" class="com.something.DefaultAccountService"/>

<!-- the following is equivalent, though redundant (singleton scope is the default) -->
<bean id="accountService" class="com.something.DefaultAccountService" scope="singleton"/>
----



[[beans-factory-scopes-prototype]]
== The Prototype Scope

The non-singleton prototype scope of bean deployment results in the creation of a new
bean instance every time a request for that specific bean is made. That is, the bean
is injected into another bean or you request it through a `getBean()` method call on the
container. As a rule, you should use the prototype scope for all stateful beans and the
singleton scope for stateless beans.

The following diagram illustrates the Infra prototype scope:

image::prototype.png[]

(A data access object
(DAO) is not typically configured as a prototype, because a typical DAO does not hold
any conversational state. It was easier for us to reuse the core of the
singleton diagram.)

The following example defines a bean as a prototype in XML:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="accountService" class="com.something.DefaultAccountService" scope="prototype"/>
----

In contrast to the other scopes, Infra does not manage the complete lifecycle of a
prototype bean. The container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a
prototype object and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype
instance. Thus, although initialization lifecycle callback methods are called on all
objects regardless of scope, in the case of prototypes, configured destruction
lifecycle callbacks are not called. The client code must clean up prototype-scoped
objects and release expensive resources that the prototype beans hold. To get
the Infra container to release resources held by prototype-scoped beans, try using a
custom xref:core/beans/factory-extension.adoc#beans-factory-extension-bpp[bean post-processor]
which holds a reference to beans that need to be cleaned up.

In some respects, the Infra container's role in regard to a prototype-scoped bean is a
replacement for the Java `new` operator. All lifecycle management past that point must
be handled by the client. (For details on the lifecycle of a bean in the Infra
container, see xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc#beans-factory-lifecycle[Lifecycle Callbacks].)



[[beans-factory-scopes-sing-prot-interaction]]
== Singleton Beans with Prototype-bean Dependencies

When you use singleton-scoped beans with dependencies on prototype beans, be aware that
dependencies are resolved at instantiation time. Thus, if you dependency-inject a
prototype-scoped bean into a singleton-scoped bean, a new prototype bean is instantiated
and then dependency-injected into the singleton bean. The prototype instance is the sole
instance that is ever supplied to the singleton-scoped bean.

However, suppose you want the singleton-scoped bean to acquire a new instance of the
prototype-scoped bean repeatedly at runtime. You cannot dependency-inject a
prototype-scoped bean into your singleton bean, because that injection occurs only
once, when the Infra container instantiates the singleton bean and resolves
and injects its dependencies. If you need a new instance of a prototype bean at
runtime more than once, see xref:core/beans/dependencies/factory-method-injection.adoc[Method Injection].



[[beans-factory-scopes-other]]
== Request, Session, Application, and WebSocket Scopes

The `request`, `session`, `application`, and `websocket` scopes are available only
if you use a web-aware Infra `ApplicationContext` implementation (such as
`XmlWebApplicationContext`). If you use these scopes with regular Infra IoC containers,
such as the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, an `IllegalStateException` that complains
about an unknown bean scope is thrown.



[[beans-factory-scopes-other-web-configuration]]
=== Initial Web Configuration

To support the scoping of beans at the `request`, `session`, `application`, and
`websocket` levels (web-scoped beans), some minor initial configuration is
required before you define your beans. (This initial setup is not required
for the standard scopes: `singleton` and `prototype`.)

How you accomplish this initial setup depends on your particular Servlet environment.

If you access scoped beans within Infra Web MVC, in effect, within a request that is
processed by the Infra `MockDispatcher`, no special setup is necessary.
`MockDispatcher` already exposes all relevant state.

If you use a Servlet web container, with requests processed outside of Infra
`MockDispatcher` (for example, when using JSF), you need to register the
`infra.web.context.request.RequestContextListener` `MockRequestListener`.
This can be done programmatically by using the `WebApplicationInitializer` interface.
Alternatively, add the following declaration to your web application's `web.xml` file:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<web-app>
  ...
  <listener>
    <listener-class>
      infra.web.context.request.RequestContextListener
    </listener-class>
  </listener>
  ...
</web-app>
----

Alternatively, if there are issues with your listener setup, consider using Infra
`RequestContextFilter`. The filter mapping depends on the surrounding web
application configuration, so you have to change it as appropriate. The following listing
shows the filter part of a web application:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<web-app>
  ...
  <filter>
    <filter-name>requestContextFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>infra.web.filter.RequestContextFilter</filter-class>
  </filter>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>requestContextFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
  ...
</web-app>
----

`MockDispatcher`, `RequestContextListener`, and `RequestContextFilter` all do exactly
the same thing, namely bind the HTTP request object to the `Thread` that is servicing
that request. This makes beans that are request- and session-scoped available further
down the call chain.



[[beans-factory-scopes-request]]
=== Request scope

Consider the following XML configuration for a bean definition:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="loginAction" class="com.something.LoginAction" scope="request"/>
----

The Infra container creates a new instance of the `LoginAction` bean by using the
`loginAction` bean definition for each and every HTTP request. That is, the
`loginAction` bean is scoped at the HTTP request level. You can change the internal
state of the instance that is created as much as you want, because other instances
created from the same `loginAction` bean definition do not see these changes in state.
They are particular to an individual request. When the request completes processing, the
bean that is scoped to the request is discarded.

When using annotation-driven components or Java configuration, the `@RequestScope` annotation
can be used to assign a component to the `request` scope. The following example shows how
to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@RequestScope
@Component
public class LoginAction {
  // ...
	}
----

======



[[beans-factory-scopes-session]]
=== Session Scope

Consider the following XML configuration for a bean definition:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.something.UserPreferences" scope="session"/>
----

The Infra container creates a new instance of the `UserPreferences` bean by using the
`userPreferences` bean definition for the lifetime of a single HTTP `Session`. In other
words, the `userPreferences` bean is effectively scoped at the HTTP `Session` level. As
with request-scoped beans, you can change the internal state of the instance that is
created as much as you want, knowing that other HTTP `Session` instances that are also
using instances created from the same `userPreferences` bean definition do not see these
changes in state, because they are particular to an individual HTTP `Session`. When the
HTTP `Session` is eventually discarded, the bean that is scoped to that particular HTTP
`Session` is also discarded.

When using annotation-driven components or Java configuration, you can use the
`@SessionScope` annotation to assign a component to the `session` scope.

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@SessionScope
@Component
public class UserPreferences {
  // ...
}
----
======



[[beans-factory-scopes-application]]
=== Application Scope

Consider the following XML configuration for a bean definition:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="appPreferences" class="com.something.AppPreferences" scope="application"/>
----

The Infra container creates a new instance of the `AppPreferences` bean by using the
`appPreferences` bean definition once for the entire web application. That is, the
`appPreferences` bean is scoped at the `MockContextImpl` level and stored as a regular
`MockContextImpl` attribute. This is somewhat similar to a Infra singleton bean but
differs in two important ways: It is a singleton per `MockContextImpl`, not per Infra
`ApplicationContext` (for which there may be several in any given web application),
and it is actually exposed and therefore visible as a `MockContextImpl` attribute.

When using annotation-driven components or Java configuration, you can use the
`@ApplicationScope` annotation to assign a component to the `application` scope. The
following example shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@ApplicationScope
@Component
public class AppPreferences {
  // ...
}
----

======



[[beans-factory-scopes-other-injection]]
=== Scoped Beans as Dependencies

The Infra IoC container manages not only the instantiation of your objects (beans),
but also the wiring up of collaborators (or dependencies). If you want to inject (for
example) an HTTP request-scoped bean into another bean of a longer-lived scope, you may
choose to inject an AOP proxy in place of the scoped bean. That is, you need to inject
a proxy object that exposes the same public interface as the scoped object but that can
also retrieve the real target object from the relevant scope (such as an HTTP request)
and delegate method calls onto the real object.

[NOTE]
====
You may also use `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` between beans that are scoped as `singleton`,
with the reference then going through an intermediate proxy that is serializable
and therefore able to re-obtain the target singleton bean on deserialization.

When declaring `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` against a bean of scope `prototype`, every method
call on the shared proxy leads to the creation of a new target instance to which the
call is then being forwarded.

Also, scoped proxies are not the only way to access beans from shorter scopes in a
lifecycle-safe fashion. You may also declare your injection point (that is, the
constructor or setter argument or autowired field) as `ObjectFactory<MyTargetBean>`,
allowing for a `getObject()` call to retrieve the current instance on demand every
time it is needed -- without holding on to the instance or storing it separately.

As an extended variant, you may declare `ObjectProvider<MyTargetBean>` which delivers
several additional access variants, including `getIfAvailable` and `getIfUnique`.

The JSR-330 variant of this is called `Provider` and is used with a `Provider<MyTargetBean>`
declaration and a corresponding `get()` call for every retrieval attempt.
See xref:core/beans/standard-annotations.adoc[here] for more details on JSR-330 overall.
====

The configuration in the following example is only one line, but it is important to
understand the "`why`" as well as the "`how`" behind it:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd">

  <!-- an HTTP Session-scoped bean exposed as a proxy -->
  <bean id="userPreferences" class="com.something.UserPreferences" scope="session">
    <!-- instructs the container to proxy the surrounding bean -->
    <aop:scoped-proxy/> <1>
  </bean>

  <!-- a singleton-scoped bean injected with a proxy to the above bean -->
  <bean id="userService" class="com.something.SimpleUserService">
    <!-- a reference to the proxied userPreferences bean -->
    <property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
  </bean>
</beans>
----
<1> The line that defines the proxy.

To create such a proxy, you insert a child `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element into a
scoped bean definition (see
xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc#beans-factory-scopes-other-injection-proxies[Choosing the Type of Proxy to Create]
and xref:core/appendix/xsd-schemas.adoc[XML Schema-based configuration]).

Why do definitions of beans scoped at the `request`, `session` and custom-scope
levels require the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element in common scenarios?
Consider the following singleton bean definition and contrast it with
what you need to define for the aforementioned scopes (note that the following
`userPreferences` bean definition as it stands is incomplete):

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.something.UserPreferences" scope="session"/>

<bean id="userManager" class="com.something.UserManager">
  <property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
</bean>
----

In the preceding example, the singleton bean (`userManager`) is injected with a reference
to the HTTP `Session`-scoped bean (`userPreferences`). The salient point here is that the
`userManager` bean is a singleton: it is instantiated exactly once per
container, and its dependencies (in this case only one, the `userPreferences` bean) are
also injected only once. This means that the `userManager` bean operates only on the
exact same `userPreferences` object (that is, the one with which it was originally injected).

This is not the behavior you want when injecting a shorter-lived scoped bean into a
longer-lived scoped bean (for example, injecting an HTTP `Session`-scoped collaborating
bean as a dependency into singleton bean). Rather, you need a single `userManager`
object, and, for the lifetime of an HTTP `Session`, you need a `userPreferences` object
that is specific to the HTTP `Session`. Thus, the container creates an object that
exposes the exact same public interface as the `UserPreferences` class (ideally an
object that is a `UserPreferences` instance), which can fetch the real
`UserPreferences` object from the scoping mechanism (HTTP request, `Session`, and so
forth). The container injects this proxy object into the `userManager` bean, which is
unaware that this `UserPreferences` reference is a proxy. In this example, when a
`UserManager` instance invokes a method on the dependency-injected `UserPreferences`
object, it is actually invoking a method on the proxy. The proxy then fetches the real
`UserPreferences` object from (in this case) the HTTP `Session` and delegates the
method invocation onto the retrieved real `UserPreferences` object.

Thus, you need the following (correct and complete) configuration when injecting
`request-` and `session-scoped` beans into collaborating objects, as the following example
shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.something.UserPreferences" scope="session">
  <aop:scoped-proxy/>
</bean>

<bean id="userManager" class="com.something.UserManager">
  <property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
</bean>
----

[[beans-factory-scopes-other-injection-proxies]]
==== Choosing the Type of Proxy to Create

By default, when the Infra container creates a proxy for a bean that is marked up with
the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element, a CGLIB-based class proxy is created.

[NOTE]
====
CGLIB proxies do not intercept private methods. Attempting to call a private method
on such a proxy will not delegate to the actual scoped target object.
====

Alternatively, you can configure the Infra container to create standard JDK
interface-based proxies for such scoped beans, by specifying `false` for the value of
the `proxy-target-class` attribute of the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element. Using JDK
interface-based proxies means that you do not need additional libraries in your
application classpath to affect such proxying. However, it also means that the class of
the scoped bean must implement at least one interface and that all collaborators
into which the scoped bean is injected must reference the bean through one of its
interfaces. The following example shows a proxy based on an interface:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<!-- DefaultUserPreferences implements the UserPreferences interface -->
<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.stuff.DefaultUserPreferences" scope="session">
  <aop:scoped-proxy proxy-target-class="false"/>
</bean>

<bean id="userManager" class="com.stuff.UserManager">
  <property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
</bean>
----

For more detailed information about choosing class-based or interface-based proxying,
see xref:core/aop/proxying.adoc[Proxying Mechanisms].



[[beans-factory-scopes-injection]]
=== Injecting Request/Session References Directly

As an alternative to factory scopes, a Infra `WebApplicationContext` also supports
the injection of `HttpMockRequest`, `HttpMockResponse`, `HttpSession`,
`WebRequest` and (if JSF is present) `FacesContext` and `ExternalContext` into
Infra-managed beans, simply through type-based autowiring next to regular injection
points for other beans. Infra generally injects proxies for such request and session
objects which has the advantage of working in singleton beans and serializable beans
as well, similar to scoped proxies for factory-scoped beans.



[[beans-factory-scopes-custom]]
== Custom Scopes

The bean scoping mechanism is extensible. You can define your own
scopes or even redefine existing scopes, although the latter is considered bad practice
and you cannot override the built-in `singleton` and `prototype` scopes.


[[beans-factory-scopes-custom-creating]]
=== Creating a Custom Scope

To integrate your custom scopes into the Infra container, you need to implement the
`infra.beans.factory.config.Scope` interface, which is described in this
section. For an idea of how to implement your own scopes, see the `Scope`
implementations that are supplied with the TODAY Framework itself and the
{today-framework-api}/beans/factory/config/Scope.html[`Scope`] javadoc,
which explains the methods you need to implement in more detail.

The `Scope` interface has four methods to get objects from the scope, remove them from
the scope, and let them be destroyed.

The session scope implementation, for example, returns the session-scoped bean (if it
does not exist, the method returns a new instance of the bean, after having bound it to
the session for future reference). The following method returns the object from the
underlying scope:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
Object get(String name, ObjectFactory<?> objectFactory)
----

======

The session scope implementation, for example, removes the session-scoped bean from the
underlying session. The object should be returned, but you can return `null` if the
object with the specified name is not found. The following method removes the object from
the underlying scope:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	Object remove(String name)
----

======

The following method registers a callback that the scope should invoke when it is
destroyed or when the specified object in the scope is destroyed:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
void registerDestructionCallback(String name, Runnable destructionCallback)
----

======

See the {today-framework-api}/beans/factory/config/Scope.html#registerDestructionCallback[javadoc]
or a Infra scope implementation for more information on destruction callbacks.

The following method obtains the conversation identifier for the underlying scope:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
String getConversationId()
----

======

This identifier is different for each scope. For a session scoped implementation, this
identifier can be the session identifier.



[[beans-factory-scopes-custom-using]]
=== Using a Custom Scope

After you write and test one or more custom `Scope` implementations, you need to make
the Infra container aware of your new scopes. The following method is the central
method to register a new `Scope` with the Infra container:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
void registerScope(String scopeName, Scope scope);
----

======

This method is declared on the `ConfigurableBeanFactory` interface, which is available
through the `BeanFactory` property on most of the concrete `ApplicationContext`
implementations that ship with Infra.

The first argument to the `registerScope(..)` method is the unique name associated with
a scope. Examples of such names in the Infra container itself are `singleton` and
`prototype`. The second argument to the `registerScope(..)` method is an actual instance
of the custom `Scope` implementation that you wish to register and use.

Suppose that you write your custom `Scope` implementation, and then register it as shown
in the next example.

NOTE: The next example uses `SimpleThreadScope`, which is included with Infra but is not
registered by default. The instructions would be the same for your own custom `Scope`
implementations.

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
Scope threadScope = new SimpleThreadScope();
beanFactory.registerScope("thread", threadScope);
----

======

You can then create bean definitions that adhere to the scoping rules of your custom
`Scope`, as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="..." class="..." scope="thread">
----

With a custom `Scope` implementation, you are not limited to programmatic registration
of the scope. You can also do the `Scope` registration declaratively, by using the
`CustomScopeConfigurer` class, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd">

  <bean class="infra.beans.factory.config.CustomScopeConfigurer">
    <property name="scopes">
      <map>
        <entry key="thread">
          <bean class="infra.context.support.SimpleThreadScope"/>
        </entry>
      </map>
    </property>
  </bean>

  <bean id="thing2" class="x.y.Thing2" scope="thread">
    <property name="name" value="Rick"/>
    <aop:scoped-proxy/>
  </bean>

  <bean id="thing1" class="x.y.Thing1">
    <property name="thing2" ref="thing2"/>
  </bean>

</beans>
----

NOTE: When you place `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` within a `<bean>` declaration for a
`FactoryBean` implementation, it is the factory bean itself that is scoped, not the object
returned from `getObject()`.
