= Using `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`

The `CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` not only recognizes the `@Resource` annotation
but also the JSR-250 lifecycle annotations: `jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct` and
`jakarta.annotation.PreDestroy`. Introduced in Spring 2.5, the support for these
annotations offers an alternative to the lifecycle callback mechanism described in
xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc#beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean[initialization callbacks] and
xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc#beans-factory-lifecycle-disposablebean[destruction callbacks]. Provided that the
`CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` is registered within the Spring `ApplicationContext`,
a method carrying one of these annotations is invoked at the same point in the lifecycle
as the corresponding Spring lifecycle interface method or explicitly declared callback
method. In the following example, the cache is pre-populated upon initialization and
cleared upon destruction:

public class CachingMovieLister {

  @PostConstruct
  public void populateMovieCache() {
    // populates the movie cache upon initialization...
  }

  @PreDestroy
  public void clearMovieCache() {
    // clears the movie cache upon destruction...
  }
}

[NOTE]
====
Like `@Resource`, the `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotation types were a part
of the standard Java libraries from JDK 6 to 8. However, the entire `javax.annotation`
package got separated from the core Java modules in JDK 9 and eventually removed in
JDK 11. As of Jakarta EE 9, the package lives in `jakarta.annotation` now. If needed,
the `jakarta.annotation-api` artifact needs to be obtained via Maven Central now,
simply to be added to the application's classpath like any other library.
