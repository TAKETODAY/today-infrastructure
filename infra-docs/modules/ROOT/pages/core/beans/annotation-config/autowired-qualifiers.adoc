= Fine-tuning Annotation-based Autowiring with Qualifiers

`@Primary` and `@Fallback` are effective ways to use autowiring by type with several
instances when one primary (or non-fallback) candidate can be determined.

When you need more control over the selection process, you can use Infra `@Qualifier`
annotation. You can associate qualifier values with specific arguments, narrowing the set
of type matches so that a specific bean is chosen for each argument. In the simplest case,
this can be a plain descriptive value, as shown in the following example:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  @Qualifier("main")
  private MovieCatalog movieCatalog;

  // ...
}
----

======
--

You can also specify the `@Qualifier` annotation on individual constructor arguments or
method parameters, as shown in the following example:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  private final MovieCatalog movieCatalog;

  private final CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao;

  @Autowired
  public void prepare(@Qualifier("main") MovieCatalog movieCatalog,
      CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao) {
    this.movieCatalog = movieCatalog;
    this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao;
  }

  // ...
}
----

The following example shows corresponding bean definitions.

--
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

  <context:annotation-config/>

  <bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog">
    <qualifier value="main"/> <1>

    <!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean -->
  </bean>

  <bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog">
    <qualifier value="action"/> <2>

    <!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean -->
  </bean>

  <bean id="movieRecommender" class="example.MovieRecommender"/>

</beans>
----
<1> The bean with the `main` qualifier value is wired with the constructor argument that
is qualified with the same value.
<2> The bean with the `action` qualifier value is wired with the constructor argument that
is qualified with the same value.
--

For a fallback match, the bean name is considered a default qualifier value. Thus, you
can define the bean with an `id` of `main` instead of the nested qualifier element, leading
to the same matching result. However, although you can use this convention to refer to
specific beans by name, `@Autowired` is fundamentally about type-driven injection with
optional semantic qualifiers. This means that qualifier values, even with the bean name
fallback, always have narrowing semantics within the set of type matches. They do not
semantically express a reference to a unique bean `id`. Good qualifier values are `main`
or `EMEA` or `persistent`, expressing characteristics of a specific component that are
independent from the bean `id`, which may be auto-generated in case of an anonymous bean
definition such as the one in the preceding example.

Qualifiers also apply to typed collections, as discussed earlier -- for example, to
`Set<MovieCatalog>`. In this case, all matching beans, according to the declared
qualifiers, are injected as a collection. This implies that qualifiers do not have to be
unique. Rather, they constitute filtering criteria. For example, you can define
multiple `MovieCatalog` beans with the same qualifier value "`action`", all of which are
injected into a `Set<MovieCatalog>` annotated with `@Qualifier("action")`.

[TIP]
====
Letting qualifier values select against target bean names, within the type-matching
candidates, does not require a `@Qualifier` annotation at the injection point.
If there is no other resolution indicator (such as a qualifier or a primary marker),
for a non-unique dependency situation, Spring matches the injection point name
(that is, the field name or parameter name) against the target bean names and chooses the
same-named candidate, if any.

Since version 6.1, this requires the `-parameters` Java compiler flag to be present.
====

That said, if you intend to express annotation-driven injection by name, do not
primarily use `@Autowired`, even if it is capable of selecting by bean name among
type-matching candidates. Instead, use the JSR-250 `@Resource` annotation, which is
semantically defined to identify a specific target component by its unique name, with
the declared type being irrelevant for the matching process. `@Autowired` has rather
different semantics: After selecting candidate beans by type, the specified `String`
qualifier value is considered within those type-selected candidates only (for example,
matching an `account` qualifier against beans marked with the same qualifier label).

For beans that are themselves defined as a collection, `Map`, or array type, `@Resource`
is a fine solution, referring to the specific collection or array bean by unique name.
That said, as of 4.3, you can match collection, `Map`, and array types through Infra
`@Autowired` type matching algorithm as well, as long as the element type information
is preserved in `@Bean` return type signatures or collection inheritance hierarchies.
In this case, you can use qualifier values to select among same-typed collections,
as outlined in the previous paragraph.

As of 4.3, `@Autowired` also considers self references for injection (that is, references
back to the bean that is currently injected). Note that self injection is a fallback.
Regular dependencies on other components always have precedence. In that sense, self
references do not participate in regular candidate selection and are therefore in
particular never primary. On the contrary, they always end up as lowest precedence.
In practice, you should use self references as a last resort only (for example, for
calling other methods on the same instance through the bean's transactional proxy).
Consider factoring out the affected methods to a separate delegate bean in such a scenario.
Alternatively, you can use `@Resource`, which may obtain a proxy back to the current bean
by its unique name.

[NOTE]
====
Trying to inject the results from `@Bean` methods on the same configuration class is
effectively a self-reference scenario as well. Either lazily resolve such references
in the method signature where it is actually needed (as opposed to an autowired field
in the configuration class) or declare the affected `@Bean` methods as `static`,
decoupling them from the containing configuration class instance and its lifecycle.
Otherwise, such beans are only considered in the fallback phase, with matching beans
on other configuration classes selected as primary candidates instead (if available).
====

`@Autowired` applies to fields, constructors, and multi-argument methods, allowing for
narrowing through qualifier annotations at the parameter level. In contrast, `@Resource`
is supported only for fields and bean property setter methods with a single argument.
As a consequence, you should stick with qualifiers if your injection target is a
constructor or a multi-argument method.

You can create your own custom qualifier annotations. To do so, define an annotation and
provide the `@Qualifier` annotation within your definition, as the following example shows:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Qualifier
public @interface Genre {

  String value();
}
----

======
--

Then you can provide the custom qualifier on autowired fields and parameters, as the
following example shows:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  @Genre("Action")
  private MovieCatalog actionCatalog;

  private MovieCatalog comedyCatalog;

  @Autowired
  public void setComedyCatalog(@Genre("Comedy") MovieCatalog comedyCatalog) {
    this.comedyCatalog = comedyCatalog;
  }

  // ...
}
----

======
--

Next, you can provide the information for the candidate bean definitions. You can add
`<qualifier/>` tags as sub-elements of the `<bean/>` tag and then specify the `type` and
`value` to match your custom qualifier annotations. The type is matched against the
fully-qualified class name of the annotation. Alternately, as a convenience if no risk of
conflicting names exists, you can use the short class name. The following example
demonstrates both approaches:

--
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

  <context:annotation-config/>

  <bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog">
    <qualifier type="Genre" value="Action"/>
    <!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean -->
  </bean>

  <bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog">
    <qualifier type="example.Genre" value="Comedy"/>
    <!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean -->
  </bean>

  <bean id="movieRecommender" class="example.MovieRecommender"/>

</beans>
----

In xref:core/beans/classpath-scanning.adoc[Classpath Scanning and Managed Components], you can see an annotation-based alternative to
providing the qualifier metadata in XML. Specifically, see xref:core/beans/classpath-scanning.adoc#beans-scanning-qualifiers[Providing Qualifier Metadata with Annotations].

In some cases, using an annotation without a value may suffice. This can be
useful when the annotation serves a more generic purpose and can be applied across
several different types of dependencies. For example, you may provide an offline
catalog that can be searched when no Internet connection is available. First, define
the simple annotation, as the following example shows:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Qualifier
public @interface Offline {
}
----

======
--

Then add the annotation to the field or property to be autowired, as shown in the
following example:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  @Offline // <1>
  private MovieCatalog offlineCatalog;

  // ...
}
----
<1> This line adds the `@Offline` annotation.

======
--

Now the bean definition only needs a qualifier `type`, as shown in the following example:

--
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog">
  <qualifier type="Offline"/> <1>
  <!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean -->
</bean>
----
<1> This element specifies the qualifier.
--


You can also define custom qualifier annotations that accept named attributes in
addition to or instead of the simple `value` attribute. If multiple attribute values are
then specified on a field or parameter to be autowired, a bean definition must match
all such attribute values to be considered an autowire candidate. As an example,
consider the following annotation definition:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Qualifier
public @interface MovieQualifier {

  String genre();

  Format format();
}
----

======
--

In this case `Format` is an enum, defined as follows:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public enum Format {
  VHS, DVD, BLURAY
}
----

======
--

The fields to be autowired are annotated with the custom qualifier and include values
for both attributes: `genre` and `format`, as the following example shows:

--
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  @MovieQualifier(format=Format.VHS, genre="Action")
  private MovieCatalog actionVhsCatalog;

  @Autowired
  @MovieQualifier(format=Format.VHS, genre="Comedy")
  private MovieCatalog comedyVhsCatalog;

  @Autowired
  @MovieQualifier(format=Format.DVD, genre="Action")
  private MovieCatalog actionDvdCatalog;

  @Autowired
  @MovieQualifier(format=Format.BLURAY, genre="Comedy")
  private MovieCatalog comedyBluRayCatalog;

  // ...
}
----

======
--

Finally, the bean definitions should contain matching qualifier values. This example
also demonstrates that you can use bean meta attributes instead of the
`<qualifier/>` elements. If available, the `<qualifier/>` element and its attributes take
precedence, but the autowiring mechanism falls back on the values provided within the
`<meta/>` tags if no such qualifier is present, as in the last two bean definitions in
the following example:

--
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

  <context:annotation-config/>

  <bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog">
    <qualifier type="MovieQualifier">
      <attribute key="format" value="VHS"/>
      <attribute key="genre" value="Action"/>
    </qualifier>
    <!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean -->
  </bean>

  <bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog">
    <qualifier type="MovieQualifier">
      <attribute key="format" value="VHS"/>
      <attribute key="genre" value="Comedy"/>
    </qualifier>
    <!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean -->
  </bean>

  <bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog">
    <meta key="format" value="DVD"/>
    <meta key="genre" value="Action"/>
    <!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean -->
  </bean>

  <bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog">
    <meta key="format" value="BLURAY"/>
    <meta key="genre" value="Comedy"/>
    <!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean -->
  </bean>

</beans>
