= Using `@Autowired`

[NOTE]
====
JSR 330's `@Inject` annotation can be used in place of Infra `@Autowired` annotation in the
examples included in this section. See xref:core/beans/standard-annotations.adoc[here] for more details.
====

You can apply the `@Autowired` annotation to constructors, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  private final CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao;

  @Autowired
  public MovieRecommender(CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao) {
    this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao;
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

[NOTE]
====
As of TODAY Framework 4.3, an `@Autowired` annotation on such a constructor is no longer
necessary if the target bean defines only one constructor to begin with. However, if
several constructors are available and there is no primary/default constructor, at least
one of the constructors must be annotated with `@Autowired` in order to instruct the
container which one to use. See the discussion on
xref:core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.adoc#beans-autowired-annotation-constructor-resolution[constructor resolution] for details.
====

You can also apply the `@Autowired` annotation to _traditional_ setter methods,
as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class SimpleMovieLister {

  private MovieFinder movieFinder;

  @Autowired
  public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
    this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

You can also apply the annotation to methods with arbitrary names and multiple
arguments, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  private MovieCatalog movieCatalog;

  private CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao;

  @Autowired
  public void prepare(MovieCatalog movieCatalog,
      CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao) {
    this.movieCatalog = movieCatalog;
    this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao;
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

You can apply `@Autowired` to fields as well and even mix it with constructors, as the
following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  private final CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao;

  @Autowired
  private MovieCatalog movieCatalog;

  @Autowired
  public MovieRecommender(CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao) {
    this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao;
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

[TIP]
====
Make sure that your target components (for example, `MovieCatalog` or `CustomerPreferenceDao`)
are consistently declared by the type that you use for your `@Autowired`-annotated
injection points. Otherwise, injection may fail due to a "no type match found" error at runtime.

For XML-defined beans or component classes found via classpath scanning, the container
usually knows the concrete type up front. However, for `@Bean` factory methods, you need
to make sure that the declared return type is sufficiently expressive. For components
that implement several interfaces or for components potentially referred to by their
implementation type, consider declaring the most specific return type on your factory
method (at least as specific as required by the injection points referring to your bean).
====

You can also instruct Infra to provide all beans of a particular type from the
`ApplicationContext` by adding the `@Autowired` annotation to a field or method that
expects an array of that type, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  private MovieCatalog[] movieCatalogs;

  // ...
}
----

======

The same applies for typed collections, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  private Set<MovieCatalog> movieCatalogs;

  @Autowired
  public void setMovieCatalogs(Set<MovieCatalog> movieCatalogs) {
    this.movieCatalogs = movieCatalogs;
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

[[beans-factory-ordered]]
[TIP]
====
Your target beans can implement the `cn.taketoday.core.Ordered` interface or use
the `@Order` or standard `@Priority` annotation if you want items in the array or list
to be sorted in a specific order. Otherwise, their order follows the registration
order of the corresponding target bean definitions in the container.

You can declare the `@Order` annotation at the target class level and on `@Bean` methods,
potentially for individual bean definitions (in case of multiple definitions that
use the same bean class). `@Order` values may influence priorities at injection points,
but be aware that they do not influence singleton startup order, which is an
orthogonal concern determined by dependency relationships and `@DependsOn` declarations.

Note that the standard `jakarta.annotation.Priority` annotation is not available at the
`@Bean` level, since it cannot be declared on methods. Its semantics can be modeled
through `@Order` values in combination with `@Primary` on a single bean for each type.
====

Even typed `Map` instances can be autowired as long as the expected key type is `String`.
The map values contain all beans of the expected type, and the keys contain the
corresponding bean names, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  private Map<String, MovieCatalog> movieCatalogs;

  @Autowired
  public void setMovieCatalogs(Map<String, MovieCatalog> movieCatalogs) {
    this.movieCatalogs = movieCatalogs;
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

By default, autowiring fails when no matching candidate beans are available for a given
injection point. In the case of a declared array, collection, or map, at least one
matching element is expected.

The default behavior is to treat annotated methods and fields as indicating required
dependencies. You can change this behavior as demonstrated in the following example,
enabling the framework to skip a non-satisfiable injection point through marking it as
non-required (i.e., by setting the `required` attribute in `@Autowired` to `false`):

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class SimpleMovieLister {

  private MovieFinder movieFinder;

  @Autowired(required = false)
  public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
    this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

[NOTE]
====
A non-required method will not be called at all if its dependency (or one of its
dependencies, in case of multiple arguments) is not available. A non-required field will
not get populated at all in such cases, leaving its default value in place.

In other words, setting the `required` attribute to `false` indicates that the
corresponding property is _optional_ for autowiring purposes, and the property will be
ignored if it cannot be autowired. This allows properties to be assigned default values
that can be optionally overridden via dependency injection.
====

[[beans-autowired-annotation-constructor-resolution]]
Injected constructor and factory method arguments are a special case since the `required`
attribute in `@Autowired` has a somewhat different meaning due to Infra constructor
resolution algorithm that may potentially deal with multiple constructors. Constructor
and factory method arguments are effectively required by default but with a few special
rules in a single-constructor scenario, such as multi-element injection points (arrays,
collections, maps) resolving to empty instances if no matching beans are available. This
allows for a common implementation pattern where all dependencies can be declared in a
unique multi-argument constructor â€” for example, declared as a single public constructor
without an `@Autowired` annotation.

[NOTE]
====
Only one constructor of any given bean class may declare `@Autowired` with the `required`
attribute set to `true`, indicating _the_ constructor to autowire when used as a Spring
bean. As a consequence, if the `required` attribute is left at its default value `true`,
only a single constructor may be annotated with `@Autowired`. If multiple constructors
declare the annotation, they will all have to declare `required=false` in order to be
considered as candidates for autowiring (analogous to `autowire=constructor` in XML).
The constructor with the greatest number of dependencies that can be satisfied by matching
beans in the Infra container will be chosen. If none of the candidates can be satisfied,
then a primary/default constructor (if present) will be used. Similarly, if a class
declares multiple constructors but none of them is annotated with `@Autowired`, then a
primary/default constructor (if present) will be used. If a class only declares a single
constructor to begin with, it will always be used, even if not annotated. Note that an
annotated constructor does not have to be public.
====

Alternatively, you can express the non-required nature of a particular dependency
through Java 8's `java.util.Optional`, as the following example shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class SimpleMovieLister {

  @Autowired
  public void setMovieFinder(Optional<MovieFinder> movieFinder) {
    ...
  }
}
----

As of TODAY Framework 5.0, you can also use a `@Nullable` annotation (of any kind
in any package -- for example, `javax.annotation.Nullable` from JSR-305) or just leverage
Kotlin built-in null-safety support:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class SimpleMovieLister {

  @Autowired
  public void setMovieFinder(@Nullable MovieFinder movieFinder) {
    ...
  }
}
----

======

You can also use `@Autowired` for interfaces that are well-known resolvable
dependencies: `BeanFactory`, `ApplicationContext`, `Environment`, `ResourceLoader`,
`ApplicationEventPublisher`, and `MessageSource`. These interfaces and their extended
interfaces, such as `ConfigurableApplicationContext` or `PatternResourceLoader`, are
automatically resolved, with no special setup necessary. The following example autowires
an `ApplicationContext` object:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  private ApplicationContext context;

  public MovieRecommender() {
  }

  // ...
}
----

======

[NOTE]
====
The `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, `@Value`, and `@Resource` annotations are handled by Spring
`BeanPostProcessor` implementations. This means that you cannot apply these annotations
within your own `BeanPostProcessor` or `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` types (if any).
These types must be 'wired up' explicitly by using XML or a Infra `@Bean` method.
