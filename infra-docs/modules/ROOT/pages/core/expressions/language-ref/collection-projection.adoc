= Collection Projection

Projection lets a collection drive the evaluation of a sub-expression, and the result is
a new collection. The syntax for projection is `.![projectionExpression]`. For example,
suppose we have a list of inventors but want the list of cities where they were born.
Effectively, we want to evaluate `placeOfBirth.city` for every entry in the inventor
list. The following example uses projection to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	// evaluates to ["Smiljan", "Idvor"]
List placesOfBirth = parser.parseExpression("members.![placeOfBirth.city]")
    .getValue(societyContext, List.class);
----

======

Projection is supported for arrays and anything that implements `java.lang.Iterable` or
`java.util.Map`. When using a map to drive projection, the projection expression is
evaluated against each entry in the map (represented as a Java `Map.Entry`). The result
of a projection across a map is a list that consists of the evaluation of the projection
expression against each map entry.

[NOTE]
====
The Spring Expression Language also supports safe navigation for collection projection.
