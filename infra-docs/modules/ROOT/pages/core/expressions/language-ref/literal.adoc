= Literal Expressions

SpEL supports the following types of literal expressions.

String ::
  Strings can be delimited by single quotation marks (`'`) or double quotation marks
  (`"`). To include a single quotation mark within a string literal enclosed in single
  quotation marks, use two adjacent single quotation mark characters. Similarly, to
  include a double quotation mark within a string literal enclosed in double quotation
  marks, use two adjacent double quotation mark characters.
Number ::
  Numbers support the use of the negative sign, exponential notation, and decimal points.
  * Integer: `int` or `long`
  * Hexadecimal: `int` or `long`
  * Real: `float` or `double`
  ** By default, real numbers are parsed using `Double.parseDouble()`.
Boolean ::
  `true` or `false`
Null ::
  `null`

[NOTE]
====
Due to the design and implementation of the Infra Expression Language, literal numbers
are always stored internally as positive numbers.

For example, `-2` is stored internally as a positive `2` which is then negated while
evaluating the expression (by calculating the value of `0 - 2`).

This means that it is not possible to represent a negative literal number equal to the
minimum value of that type of number in Java. For example, the minimum supported value
for an `int` in Java is `Integer.MIN_VALUE` which has a value of `-2147483648`. However,
if you include `-2147483648` in a SpEL expression, an exception will be thrown informing
you that the value `2147483648` cannot be parsed as an `int` (because it exceeds the
value of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` which is `2147483647`).

If you need to use the minimum value for a particular type of number within a SpEL
expression, you can either reference the `MIN_VALUE` constant for the respective wrapper
type (such as `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, `Long.MIN_VALUE`, etc.) or calculate the minimum
value. For example, to use the minimum integer value:

- `T(Integer).MIN_VALUE` -- requires a `StandardEvaluationContext`
- `-2^31` -- can be used with any type of `EvaluationContext`
====

The following listing shows simple usage of literals. Typically, they are not used in
isolation like this but, rather, as part of a more complex expression -- for example,
using a literal on one side of a logical comparison operator or as an argument to a
method.
