= Collection Selection

Selection is a powerful expression language feature that lets you transform a
source collection into another collection by selecting from its entries.

Selection uses a syntax of `.?[selectionExpression]`. It filters the collection and
returns a new collection that contains a subset of the original elements. For example,
selection lets us easily get a list of Serbian inventors, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
List<Inventor> list = (List<Inventor>) parser.parseExpression(
    "members.?[nationality == 'Serbian']").getValue(societyContext);
----

======

Selection is supported for arrays and anything that implements `java.lang.Iterable` or
`java.util.Map`. For an array or `Iterable`, the selection expression is evaluated
against each individual element. Against a map, the selection expression is evaluated
against each map entry (objects of the Java type `Map.Entry`). Each map entry has its
`key` and `value` accessible as properties for use in the selection.

Given a `Map` stored in a variable named `#map`, the following expression returns a new
map that consists of those elements of the original map where the entry's value is less
than 27:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	Map newMap = parser.parseExpression("#map.?[value < 27]").getValue(Map.class);
----

======

In addition to returning all the selected elements, you can retrieve only the first or
the last element. To obtain the first element matching the selection expression, the
syntax is `.^[selectionExpression]`. To obtain the last element matching the selection
expression, the syntax is `.$[selectionExpression]`.

[NOTE]
====
The Infra Expression Language also supports safe navigation for collection selection.
