= Expression Templating

Expression templates allow mixing literal text with one or more evaluation blocks.
Each evaluation block is delimited with prefix and suffix characters that you can
define. A common choice is to use `+#{ }+` as the delimiters, as the following example
shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
String randomPhrase = parser.parseExpression(
    "random number is #{T(java.lang.Math).random()}",
    new TemplateParserContext()).getValue(String.class);

// evaluates to "random number is 0.7038186818312008"
----

======

The string is evaluated by concatenating the literal text `'random number is '` with the
result of evaluating the expression inside the `+#{ }+` delimiters (in this case, the
result of calling that `random()` method). The second argument to the `parseExpression()`
method is of the type `ParserContext`. The `ParserContext` interface is used to influence
how the expression is parsed in order to support the expression templating functionality.
The `TemplateParserContext` used in the previous example resides in the
`infra.expression.common` package and is an implementation of the
`ParserContext` which by default configures the prefix and suffix to `#{` and `}`,
respectively.
