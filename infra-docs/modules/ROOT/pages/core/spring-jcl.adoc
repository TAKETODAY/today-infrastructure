[[spring-jcl]]
= Logging

Since TODAY Framework 5.0, Infra comes with its own Commons Logging bridge implemented
in the `spring-jcl` module. The implementation checks for the presence of the Log4j 2.x
API and the SLF4J 1.7 API in the classpath and uses the first one of those found as the
logging implementation, falling back to the Java platform's core logging facilities (also
known as _JUL_ or `java.util.logging`) if neither Log4j 2.x nor SLF4J is available.

Put Log4j 2.x or Logback (or another SLF4J provider) in your classpath, without any extra
bridges, and let the framework auto-adapt to your choice. For further information see the
{today-framework-reference}/features.html#features.logging[Spring
Boot Logging Reference Documentation].

[NOTE]
====
Infra Commons Logging variant is only meant to be used for infrastructure logging
purposes in the core framework and in extensions.

For logging needs within application code, prefer direct use of Log4j 2.x, SLF4J, or JUL.
====

A `Log` implementation may be retrieved via `org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory` as in
the following example.
