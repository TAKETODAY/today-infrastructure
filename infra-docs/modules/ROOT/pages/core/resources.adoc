[[resources-introduction]]
== Introduction

Java's standard `java.net.URL` class and standard handlers for various URL prefixes,
unfortunately, are not quite adequate enough for all access to low-level resources. For
example, there is no standardized `URL` implementation that may be used to access a
resource that needs to be obtained from the classpath or relative to a
`ServletContext`. While it is possible to register new handlers for specialized `URL`
prefixes (similar to existing handlers for prefixes such as `http:`), this is generally
quite complicated, and the `URL` interface still lacks some desirable functionality,
such as a method to check for the existence of the resource being pointed to.




[[resources-resource]]
== The `Resource` Interface

Spring's `Resource` interface located in the `cn.taketoday.core.io.` package is
meant to be a more capable interface for abstracting access to low-level resources. The
following listing provides an overview of the `Resource` interface. See the
{today-framework-api}/core/io/Resource.html[`Resource`] javadoc for further details.


[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface Resource extends InputStreamSource {

  boolean exists();

  boolean isReadable();

  boolean isOpen();

  boolean isFile();

  URL getURL() throws IOException;

  URI getURI() throws IOException;

  File getFile() throws IOException;

  ReadableByteChannel readableChannel() throws IOException;

  long contentLength() throws IOException;

  long lastModified() throws IOException;

  Resource createRelative(String relativePath) throws IOException;

  String getName();

  String getDescription();
}
----

As the definition of the `Resource` interface shows, it extends the `InputStreamSource`
interface. The following listing shows the definition of the `InputStreamSource`
interface:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface InputStreamSource {

  InputStream getInputStream() throws IOException;
}
----

Some of the most important methods from the `Resource` interface are:

* `getInputStream()`: Locates and opens the resource, returning an `InputStream` for
  reading from the resource. It is expected that each invocation returns a fresh
  `InputStream`. It is the responsibility of the caller to close the stream.
* `exists()`: Returns a `boolean` indicating whether this resource actually exists in
  physical form.
* `isOpen()`: Returns a `boolean` indicating whether this resource represents a handle
  with an open stream. If `true`, the `InputStream` cannot be read multiple times and
  must be read once only and then closed to avoid resource leaks. Returns `false` for
  all usual resource implementations, with the exception of `InputStreamResource`.
* `getDescription()`: Returns a description for this resource, to be used for error
  output when working with the resource. This is often the fully qualified file name or
  the actual URL of the resource.

Other methods let you obtain an actual `URL` or `File` object representing the
resource (if the underlying implementation is compatible and supports that
functionality).

Some implementations of the `Resource` interface also implement the extended
{today-framework-api}/core/io/WritableResource.html[`WritableResource`] interface
for a resource that supports writing to it.

Spring itself uses the `Resource` abstraction extensively, as an argument type in
many method signatures when a resource is needed. Other methods in some Infra APIs
(such as the constructors to various `ApplicationContext` implementations) take a
`String` which in unadorned or simple form is used to create a `Resource` appropriate to
that context implementation or, via special prefixes on the `String` path, let the
caller specify that a specific `Resource` implementation must be created and used.

While the `Resource` interface is used a lot with Spring and by Spring, it is actually
very convenient to use as a general utility class by itself in your own code, for access
to resources, even when your code does not know or care about any other parts of Spring.
While this couples your code to Spring, it really only couples it to this small set of
utility classes, which serves as a more capable replacement for `URL` and can be
considered equivalent to any other library you would use for this purpose.

NOTE: The `Resource` abstraction does not replace functionality. It wraps it where
possible. For example, a `UrlResource` wraps a URL and uses the wrapped `URL` to do its
work.




[[resources-implementations]]
== Built-in `Resource` Implementations

Spring includes several built-in `Resource` implementations:

* xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-implementations-urlresource[`UrlResource`]
* xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-implementations-classpathresource[`ClassPathResource`]
* xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-implementations-filesystemresource[`FileSystemResource`]
* xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-implementations-pathresource[`PathResource`]
* xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-implementations-servletcontextresource[`ServletContextResource`]
* xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-implementations-inputstreamresource[`InputStreamResource`]
* xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-implementations-bytearrayresource[`ByteArrayResource`]

For a complete list of `Resource` implementations available in Spring, consult the
"All Known Implementing Classes" section of the
{today-framework-api}/core/io/Resource.html[`Resource`] javadoc.



[[resources-implementations-urlresource]]
=== `UrlResource`

`UrlResource` wraps a `java.net.URL` and can be used to access any object that is
normally accessible with a URL, such as files, an HTTPS target, an FTP target, and
others. All URLs have a standardized `String` representation, such that appropriate
standardized prefixes are used to indicate one URL type from another. This includes
`file:` for accessing filesystem paths, `https:` for accessing resources through the
HTTPS protocol, `ftp:` for accessing resources through FTP, and others.

A `UrlResource` is created by Java code by explicitly using the `UrlResource` constructor
but is often created implicitly when you call an API method that takes a `String`
argument meant to represent a path. For the latter case, a JavaBeans `PropertyEditor`
ultimately decides which type of `Resource` to create. If the path string contains a
well-known (to property editor, that is) prefix (such as `classpath:`), it creates an
appropriate specialized `Resource` for that prefix. However, if it does not recognize the
prefix, it assumes the string is a standard URL string and creates a `UrlResource`.



[[resources-implementations-classpathresource]]
=== `ClassPathResource`

This class represents a resource that should be obtained from the classpath. It uses
either the thread context class loader, a given class loader, or a given class for
loading resources.

This `Resource` implementation supports resolution as a `java.io.File` if the class path
resource resides in the file system but not for classpath resources that reside in a
jar and have not been expanded (by the servlet engine or whatever the environment is)
to the filesystem. To address this, the various `Resource` implementations always support
resolution as a `java.net.URL`.

A `ClassPathResource` is created by Java code by explicitly using the `ClassPathResource`
constructor but is often created implicitly when you call an API method that takes a
`String` argument meant to represent a path. For the latter case, a JavaBeans
`PropertyEditor` recognizes the special prefix, `classpath:`, on the string path and
creates a `ClassPathResource` in that case.



[[resources-implementations-filesystemresource]]
=== `FileSystemResource`

This is a `Resource` implementation for `java.io.File` handles. It also supports
`java.nio.file.Path` handles, applying Spring's standard String-based path
transformations but performing all operations via the `java.nio.file.Files` API. For pure
`java.nio.path.Path` based support use a `PathResource` instead. `FileSystemResource`
supports resolution as a `File` and as a `URL`.



[[resources-implementations-pathresource]]
=== `PathResource`

This is a `Resource` implementation for `java.nio.file.Path` handles, performing all
operations and transformations via the `Path` API. It supports resolution as a `File` and
as a `URL` and also implements the extended `WritableResource` interface. `PathResource`
is effectively a pure `java.nio.path.Path` based alternative to `FileSystemResource` with
different `createRelative` behavior.



[[resources-implementations-servletcontextresource]]
=== `ServletContextResource`

This is a `Resource` implementation for `ServletContext` resources that interprets
relative paths within the relevant web application's root directory.

It always supports stream access and URL access but allows `java.io.File` access only
when the web application archive is expanded and the resource is physically on the
filesystem. Whether or not it is expanded and on the filesystem or accessed
directly from the JAR or somewhere else like a database (which is conceivable) is actually
dependent on the Servlet container.



[[resources-implementations-inputstreamresource]]
=== `InputStreamResource`

An `InputStreamResource` is a `Resource` implementation for a given `InputStream`. It
should be used only if no specific `Resource` implementation is applicable. In
particular, prefer `ByteArrayResource` or any of the file-based `Resource`
implementations where possible.

In contrast to other `Resource` implementations, this is a descriptor for an
already-opened resource. Therefore, it returns `true` from `isOpen()`. Do not use it if
you need to keep the resource descriptor somewhere or if you need to read a stream
multiple times.



[[resources-implementations-bytearrayresource]]
=== `ByteArrayResource`

This is a `Resource` implementation for a given byte array. It creates a
`ByteArrayInputStream` for the given byte array.

It is useful for loading content from any given byte array without having to resort to a
single-use `InputStreamResource`.




[[resources-resourceloader]]
== The `ResourceLoader` Interface

The `ResourceLoader` interface is meant to be implemented by objects that can return
(that is, load) `Resource` instances. The following listing shows the `ResourceLoader`
interface definition:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface ResourceLoader {

  Resource getResource(String location);

  ClassLoader getClassLoader();
}
----

All application contexts implement the `ResourceLoader` interface. Therefore, all
application contexts may be used to obtain `Resource` instances.

When you call `getResource()` on a specific application context, and the location path
specified doesn't have a specific prefix, you get back a `Resource` type that is
appropriate to that particular application context. For example, assume the following
snippet of code was run against a `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` instance:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
Resource template = ctx.getResource("some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
----

======

Against a `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, that code returns a `ClassPathResource`. If
the same method were run against a `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext` instance, it would
return a `FileSystemResource`. For a `WebApplicationContext`, it would return a
`ServletContextResource`. It would similarly return appropriate objects for each context.

As a result, you can load resources in a fashion appropriate to the particular application
context.

On the other hand, you may also force `ClassPathResource` to be used, regardless of the
application context type, by specifying the special `classpath:` prefix, as the following
example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
Resource template = ctx.getResource("classpath:some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
----

======

Similarly, you can force a `UrlResource` to be used by specifying any of the standard
`java.net.URL` prefixes. The following examples use the `file` and `https` prefixes:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
Resource template = ctx.getResource("file:///some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
----

======

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	Resource template = ctx.getResource("https://myhost.com/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
----
======

The following table summarizes the strategy for converting `String` objects to `Resource`
objects:

[[resources-resource-strings]]
.Resource strings
|===
| Prefix| Example| Explanation

| classpath:
| `classpath:com/myapp/config.xml`
| Loaded from the classpath.

| file:
| `\file:///data/config.xml`
| Loaded as a `URL` from the filesystem. See also xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-filesystemresource-caveats[`FileSystemResource` Caveats].

| https:
| `\https://myserver/logo.png`
| Loaded as a `URL`.

| (none)
| `/data/config.xml`
| Depends on the underlying `ApplicationContext`.
|===




[[resources-resourcepatternresolver]]
== The `PatternResourceLoader` Interface

The `PatternResourceLoader` interface is an extension to the `ResourceLoader` interface
which defines a strategy for resolving a location pattern (for example, an Ant-style path
pattern) into  `Resource` objects.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface PatternResourceLoader extends ResourceLoader {

  String CLASSPATH_ALL_URL_PREFIX = "classpath*:";

  Resource[] getResourcesArray(String locationPattern) throws IOException;
}
----

As can be seen above, this interface also defines a special `classpath*:` resource prefix
for all matching resources from the class path. Note that the resource location is
expected to be a path without placeholders in this case -- for example,
`classpath*:/config/beans.xml`. JAR files or different directories in the class path can
contain multiple files with the same path and the same name. See
xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-app-ctx-wildcards-in-resource-paths[Wildcards in Application Context Constructor Resource Paths] and its subsections for further details
on wildcard support with the `classpath*:` resource prefix.

A passed-in `ResourceLoader` (for example, one supplied via
xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-resourceloaderaware[`ResourceLoaderAware`] semantics) can be checked whether
it implements this extended interface too.

`PathMatchingPatternResourceLoader` is a standalone implementation that is usable
outside an `ApplicationContext` and is also used by `ResourceArrayPropertyEditor` for
populating `Resource[]` bean properties. `PathMatchingPatternResourceLoader` is able to
resolve a specified resource location path into one or more matching `Resource` objects.
The source path may be a simple path which has a one-to-one mapping to a target
`Resource`, or alternatively may contain the special `classpath*:` prefix and/or internal
Ant-style regular expressions (matched using Spring's
`cn.taketoday.util.AntPathMatcher` utility). Both of the latter are effectively
wildcards.

[NOTE]
====
The default `ResourceLoader` in any standard `ApplicationContext` is in fact an instance
of `PathMatchingPatternResourceLoader` which implements the `PatternResourceLoader`
interface. The same is true for the `ApplicationContext` instance itself which also
implements the `PatternResourceLoader` interface and delegates to the default
`PathMatchingPatternResourceLoader`.
====




[[resources-resourceloaderaware]]
== The `ResourceLoaderAware` Interface

The `ResourceLoaderAware` interface is a special callback interface which identifies
components that expect to be provided a `ResourceLoader` reference. The following listing
shows the definition of the `ResourceLoaderAware` interface:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface ResourceLoaderAware {

		void setResourceLoader(ResourceLoader resourceLoader);
	}
----

When a class implements `ResourceLoaderAware` and is deployed into an application context
(as a Spring-managed bean), it is recognized as `ResourceLoaderAware` by the application
context. The application context then invokes `setResourceLoader(ResourceLoader)`,
supplying itself as the argument (remember, all application contexts in Spring implement
the `ResourceLoader` interface).

Since an `ApplicationContext` is a `ResourceLoader`, the bean could also implement the
`ApplicationContextAware` interface and use the supplied application context directly to
load resources. However, in general, it is better to use the specialized `ResourceLoader`
interface if that is all you need. The code would be coupled only to the resource loading
interface (which can be considered a utility interface) and not to the whole Spring
`ApplicationContext` interface.

In application components, you may also rely upon autowiring of the `ResourceLoader` as
an alternative to implementing the `ResourceLoaderAware` interface. The _traditional_
`constructor` and `byType` autowiring modes (as described in xref:core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.adoc[Autowiring Collaborators])
are capable of providing a `ResourceLoader` for either a constructor argument or a
setter method parameter, respectively. For more flexibility (including the ability to
autowire fields and multiple parameter methods), consider using the annotation-based
autowiring features. In that case, the `ResourceLoader` is autowired into a field,
constructor argument, or method parameter that expects the `ResourceLoader` type as long
as the field, constructor, or method in question carries the `@Autowired` annotation.
For more information, see xref:core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.adoc[Using `@Autowired`].

NOTE: To load one or more `Resource` objects for a resource path that contains wildcards
or makes use of the special `classpath*:` resource prefix, consider having an instance of
xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-resourcepatternresolver[`PatternResourceLoader`] autowired into your
application components instead of `ResourceLoader`.




[[resources-as-dependencies]]
== Resources as Dependencies

If the bean itself is going to determine and supply the resource path through some sort
of dynamic process, it probably makes sense for the bean to use the `ResourceLoader` or
`PatternResourceLoader` interface to load resources. For example, consider the loading
of a template of some sort, where the specific resource that is needed depends on the
role of the user. If the resources are static, it makes sense to eliminate the use of the
`ResourceLoader` interface (or `PatternResourceLoader` interface) completely, have the
bean expose the `Resource` properties it needs, and expect them to be injected into it.

What makes it trivial to then inject these properties is that all application contexts
register and use a special JavaBeans `PropertyEditor`, which can convert `String` paths
to `Resource` objects. For example, the following `MyBean` class has a `template`
property of type `Resource`.

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	package example;

	public class MyBean {

		private Resource template;

		public setTemplate(Resource template) {
			this.template = template;
		}

		// ...
	}
----

======

In an XML configuration file, the `template` property can be configured with a simple
string for that resource, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="myBean" class="example.MyBean">
		<property name="template" value="some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt"/>
	</bean>
----

Note that the resource path has no prefix. Consequently, because the application context
itself is going to be used as the `ResourceLoader`, the resource is loaded through a
`ClassPathResource`, a `FileSystemResource`, or a `ServletContextResource`, depending on
the exact type of the application context.

If you need to force a specific `Resource` type to be used, you can use a prefix. The
following two examples show how to force a `ClassPathResource` and a `UrlResource` (the
latter being used to access a file in the filesystem):

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<property name="template" value="classpath:some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt">
----

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<property name="template" value="file:///some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt"/>
----

If the `MyBean` class is refactored for use with annotation-driven configuration, the
path to `myTemplate.txt` can be stored under a key named `template.path` -- for example,
in a properties file made available to the Spring `Environment` (see
xref:core/beans/environment.adoc[Environment Abstraction]). The template path can then be referenced via the `@Value`
annotation using a property placeholder (see xref:core/beans/annotation-config/value-annotations.adoc[Using `@Value`]). Spring will
retrieve the value of the template path as a string, and a special `PropertyEditor` will
convert the string to a `Resource` object to be injected into the `MyBean` constructor.
The following example demonstrates how to achieve this.

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	@Component
	public class MyBean {

		private final Resource template;

		public MyBean(@Value("${template.path}") Resource template) {
			this.template = template;
		}

		// ...
	}
----

======

If we want to support multiple templates discovered under the same path in multiple
locations in the classpath -- for example, in multiple jars in the classpath -- we can
use the special `classpath*:` prefix and wildcarding to define a `templates.path` key as
`classpath*:/config/templates/*.txt`. If we redefine the `MyBean` class as follows,
Spring will convert the template path pattern into an array of `Resource` objects that
can be injected into the `MyBean` constructor.

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	@Component
	public class MyBean {

		private final Resource[] templates;

		public MyBean(@Value("${templates.path}") Resource[] templates) {
			this.templates = templates;
		}

		// ...
	}
----

======




[[resources-app-ctx]]
== Application Contexts and Resource Paths

This section covers how to create application contexts with resources, including shortcuts
that work with XML, how to use wildcards, and other details.



[[resources-app-ctx-construction]]
=== Constructing Application Contexts

An application context constructor (for a specific application context type) generally
takes a string or array of strings as the location paths of the resources, such as
XML files that make up the definition of the context.

When such a location path does not have a prefix, the specific `Resource` type built from
that path and used to load the bean definitions depends on and is appropriate to the
specific application context. For example, consider the following example, which creates a
`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("conf/appContext.xml");
----

======

The bean definitions are loaded from the classpath, because a `ClassPathResource` is
used. However, consider the following example, which creates a `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	ApplicationContext ctx =
		new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("conf/appContext.xml");
----

======

Now the bean definitions are loaded from a filesystem location (in this case, relative to
the current working directory).

Note that the use of the special `classpath` prefix or a standard URL prefix on the
location path overrides the default type of `Resource` created to load the bean
definitions. Consider the following example:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	ApplicationContext ctx =
		new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("classpath:conf/appContext.xml");
----

======

Using `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext` loads the bean definitions from the classpath.
However, it is still a `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`. If it is subsequently used as a
`ResourceLoader`, any unprefixed paths are still treated as filesystem paths.


[[resources-app-ctx-classpathxml]]
==== Constructing `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` Instances -- Shortcuts

The `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` exposes a number of constructors to enable
convenient instantiation. The basic idea is that you can supply merely a string array
that contains only the filenames of the XML files themselves (without the leading path
information) and also supply a `Class`. The `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` then derives
the path information from the supplied class.

Consider the following directory layout:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
com/
  example/
    services.xml
    repositories.xml
    MessengerService.class
----

The following example shows how a `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` instance composed of
the beans defined in files named `services.xml` and `repositories.xml` (which are on the
classpath) can be instantiated:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
		new String[] {"services.xml", "repositories.xml"}, MessengerService.class);
----

======

See the {today-framework-api}/context/support/ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.html[`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`]
javadoc for details on the various constructors.



[[resources-app-ctx-wildcards-in-resource-paths]]
=== Wildcards in Application Context Constructor Resource Paths

The resource paths in application context constructor values may be simple paths (as
shown earlier), each of which has a one-to-one mapping to a target `Resource` or,
alternately, may contain the special `classpath*:` prefix or internal Ant-style patterns
(matched by using Spring's `PathMatcher` utility). Both of the latter are effectively
wildcards.

One use for this mechanism is when you need to do component-style application assembly. All
components can _publish_ context definition fragments to a well-known location path, and,
when the final application context is created using the same path prefixed with
`classpath*:`, all component fragments are automatically picked up.

Note that this wildcarding is specific to the use of resource paths in application context
constructors (or when you use the `PathMatcher` utility class hierarchy directly) and is
resolved at construction time. It has nothing to do with the `Resource` type itself.
You cannot use the `classpath*:` prefix to construct an actual `Resource`, as
a resource points to just one resource at a time.


[[resources-app-ctx-ant-patterns-in-paths]]
==== Ant-style Patterns

Path locations can contain Ant-style patterns, as the following example shows:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
/WEB-INF/\*-context.xml
com/mycompany/\**/applicationContext.xml
file:C:/some/path/\*-context.xml
classpath:com/mycompany/**/applicationContext.xml
----

When the path location contains an Ant-style pattern, the resolver follows a more complex
procedure to try to resolve the wildcard. It produces a `Resource` for the path up to the
last non-wildcard segment and obtains a URL from it. If this URL is not a `jar:` URL or
container-specific variant (such as `zip:` in WebLogic, `wsjar` in WebSphere, and so on),
a `java.io.File` is obtained from it and used to resolve the wildcard by traversing the
filesystem. In the case of a jar URL, the resolver either gets a
`java.net.JarURLConnection` from it or manually parses the jar URL and then traverses the
contents of the jar file to resolve the wildcards.

[[resources-app-ctx-portability]]
===== Implications on Portability

If the specified path is already a `file` URL (either implicitly because the base
`ResourceLoader` is a filesystem one or explicitly), wildcarding is guaranteed to
work in a completely portable fashion.

If the specified path is a `classpath` location, the resolver must obtain the last
non-wildcard path segment URL by making a `Classloader.getResource()` call. Since this
is just a node of the path (not the file at the end), it is actually undefined (in the
`ClassLoader` javadoc) exactly what sort of a URL is returned in this case. In practice,
it is always a `java.io.File` representing the directory (where the classpath resource
resolves to a filesystem location) or a jar URL of some sort (where the classpath resource
resolves to a jar location). Still, there is a portability concern on this operation.

If a jar URL is obtained for the last non-wildcard segment, the resolver must be able to
get a `java.net.JarURLConnection` from it or manually parse the jar URL, to be able to
walk the contents of the jar and resolve the wildcard. This does work in most environments
but fails in others, and we strongly recommend that the wildcard resolution of resources
coming from jars be thoroughly tested in your specific environment before you rely on it.


[[resources-classpath-wildcards]]
==== The `classpath*:` Prefix

When constructing an XML-based application context, a location string may use the
special `classpath*:` prefix, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	ApplicationContext ctx =
		new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("classpath*:conf/appContext.xml");
----

======

This special prefix specifies that all classpath resources that match the given name
must be obtained (internally, this essentially happens through a call to
`ClassLoader.getResources(...)`) and then merged to form the final application
context definition.

NOTE: The wildcard classpath relies on the `getResources()` method of the underlying
`ClassLoader`. As most application servers nowadays supply their own `ClassLoader`
implementation, the behavior might differ, especially when dealing with jar files. A
simple test to check if `classpath*` works is to use the `ClassLoader` to load a file from
within a jar on the classpath:
`getClass().getClassLoader().getResources("<someFileInsideTheJar>")`. Try this test with
files that have the same name but reside in two different locations -- for example, files
with the same name and same path but in different jars on the classpath. In case an
inappropriate result is returned, check the application server documentation for settings
that might affect the `ClassLoader` behavior.

You can also combine the `classpath*:` prefix with a `PathMatcher` pattern in the
rest of the location path (for example, `classpath*:META-INF/*-beans.xml`). In this
case, the resolution strategy is fairly simple: A `ClassLoader.getResources()` call is
used on the last non-wildcard path segment to get all the matching resources in the
class loader hierarchy and then, off each resource, the same `PathMatcher` resolution
strategy described earlier is used for the wildcard subpath.


[[resources-wildcards-in-path-other-stuff]]
==== Other Notes Relating to Wildcards

Note that `classpath*:`, when combined with Ant-style patterns, only works
reliably with at least one root directory before the pattern starts, unless the actual
target files reside in the file system. This means that a pattern such as
`classpath*:*.xml` might not retrieve files from the root of jar files but rather only
from the root of expanded directories.

Spring's ability to retrieve classpath entries originates from the JDK's
`ClassLoader.getResources()` method, which only returns file system locations for an
empty string (indicating potential roots to search). Spring evaluates
`URLClassLoader` runtime configuration and the `java.class.path` manifest in jar files
as well, but this is not guaranteed to lead to portable behavior.

[NOTE]
====
The scanning of classpath packages requires the presence of corresponding directory
entries in the classpath. When you build JARs with Ant, do not activate the `files-only`
switch of the JAR task. Also, classpath directories may not get exposed based on security
policies in some environments -- for example, stand-alone applications on JDK 1.7.0_45
and higher (which requires 'Trusted-Library' to be set up in your manifests.

On JDK 9's module path (Jigsaw), Spring's classpath scanning generally works as expected.
Putting resources into a dedicated directory is highly recommendable here as well,
avoiding the aforementioned portability problems with searching the jar file root level.
====

Ant-style patterns with `classpath:` resources are not guaranteed to find matching
resources if the root package to search is available in multiple classpath locations.
Consider the following example of a resource location:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
com/mycompany/package1/service-context.xml
----

Now consider an Ant-style path that someone might use to try to find that file:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
classpath:com/mycompany/**/service-context.xml
----

Such a resource may exist in only one location in the classpath, but when a path such as
the preceding example is used to try to resolve it, the resolver works off the (first)
URL returned by `getResource("com/mycompany");`. If this base package node exists in
multiple `ClassLoader` locations, the desired resource may not exist in the first
location found. Therefore, in such cases you should prefer using `classpath*:` with the
same Ant-style pattern, which searches all classpath locations that contain the
`com.mycompany` base package: `classpath*:com/mycompany/**/service-context.xml`.

=== `FileSystemResource` Caveats

A `FileSystemResource` that is not attached to a `FileSystemApplicationContext` (that
is, when a `FileSystemApplicationContext` is not the actual `ResourceLoader`) treats
absolute and relative paths as you would expect. Relative paths are relative to the
current working directory, while absolute paths are relative to the root of the
filesystem.

For backwards compatibility (historical) reasons however, this changes when the
`FileSystemApplicationContext` is the `ResourceLoader`. The
`FileSystemApplicationContext` forces all attached `FileSystemResource` instances
to treat all location paths as relative, whether they start with a leading slash or not.
In practice, this means the following examples are equivalent:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	ApplicationContext ctx =
		new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("conf/context.xml");
----

======

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	ApplicationContext ctx =
		new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("/conf/context.xml");
----

======

The following examples are also equivalent (even though it would make sense for them to be different, as one
case is relative and the other absolute):

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	FileSystemXmlApplicationContext ctx = ...;
	ctx.getResource("some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
----

======

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	FileSystemXmlApplicationContext ctx = ...;
	ctx.getResource("/some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
----

======

In practice, if you need true absolute filesystem paths, you should avoid using
absolute paths with `FileSystemResource` or `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext` and
force the use of a `UrlResource` by using the `file:` URL prefix. The following examples
show how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	// actual context type doesn't matter, the Resource will always be UrlResource
	ctx.getResource("file:///some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
----

======

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	// force this FileSystemXmlApplicationContext to load its definition via a UrlResource
	ApplicationContext ctx =
		new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("file:///conf/context.xml");
----

======
