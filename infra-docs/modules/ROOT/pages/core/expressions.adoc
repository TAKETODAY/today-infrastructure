= Spring Expression Language (SpEL)

The Spring Expression Language ("SpEL" for short) is a powerful expression language that
supports querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime. The language syntax is
similar to the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/expression-language/[Jakarta Expression
Language] but offers additional features, most notably method invocation and basic string
templating functionality.

While there are several other Java expression languages available -- OGNL, MVEL, and JBoss
EL, to name a few -- the Spring Expression Language was created to provide the Spring
community with a single well supported expression language that can be used across all
the products in the Spring portfolio. Its language features are driven by the
requirements of the projects in the Spring portfolio, including tooling requirements
for code completion support within the {today-tech-site-tools}[Spring Tools for Eclipse].
That said, SpEL is based on a technology-agnostic API that lets other expression language
implementations be integrated, should the need arise.

While SpEL serves as the foundation for expression evaluation within the Spring
portfolio, it is not directly tied to Spring and can be used independently. To
be self contained, many of the examples in this chapter use SpEL as if it were an
independent expression language. This requires creating a few bootstrapping
infrastructure classes, such as the parser. Most Spring users need not deal with
this infrastructure and can, instead, author only expression strings for evaluation.
An example of this typical use is the integration of SpEL into creating XML or
annotation-based bean definitions, as shown in
xref:core/expressions/beandef.adoc[Expression support for defining bean definitions].

This chapter covers the features of the expression language, its API, and its language
syntax. In several places, `Inventor` and `Society` classes are used as the target
objects for expression evaluation. These class declarations and the data used to
populate them are listed at the end of the chapter.

The expression language supports the following functionality:

* Literal expressions
* Accessing properties, arrays, lists, and maps
* Inline lists
* Inline maps
* Array construction
* Relational operators
* Regular expressions
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Mathematical operators
* Assignment
* Type expressions
* Method invocation
* Constructor invocation
* Variables
* User-defined functions
* Bean references
* Ternary, Elvis, and safe-navigation operators
* Collection projection
* Collection selection
* Templated expressions
