[[beans-binding]]
= Data Binding

Data binding is useful for binding user input to a target object where user input is a map
with property paths as keys, following xref:beans-beans-conventions[JavaBeans conventions].
`DataBinder` is the main class that supports this, and it provides two ways to bind user
input:

- xref:beans-constructor-binding[Constructor binding] - bind user input to a public data
constructor, looking up constructor argument values in the user input.
- xref:beans-beans[Property binding] - bind user input to setters, matching keys from the
user input to properties of the target object structure.

You can apply both constructor and property binding or only one.


[[beans-constructor-binding]]
== Constructor Binding

To use constructor binding:

1. Create a `DataBinder` with `null` as the target object.
2. Set `targetType` to the target class.
3. Call `construct`.

The target class should have a single public constructor or a single non-public constructor
with arguments. If there are multiple constructors, then a default constructor if present
is used.

By default, constructor parameter names are used to look up argument values, but you can
configure a `NameResolver`. Web MVC and WebFlux both rely to allow customizing the name
of the value to bind through an `@BindParam` annotation on constructor parameters.

xref:beans-beans-conventions[Type conversion] is applied as needed to convert user input.
If the constructor parameter is an object, it is constructed recursively in the same
manner, but through a nested property path. That means constructor binding creates both
the target object and any objects it contains.

Binding and conversion errors are reflected in the `BindingResult` of the `DataBinder`.
If the target is created successfully, then `target` is set to the created instance
after the call to `construct`.




[[beans-beans]]
== Property Binding with `BeanWrapper`

The `infra.beans` package adheres to the JavaBeans standard.
A JavaBean is a class with a default no-argument constructor and that follows
a naming convention where (for example) a property named `bingoMadness` would
have a setter method `setBingoMadness(..)` and a getter method `getBingoMadness()`. For
more information about JavaBeans and the specification, see
{java-api}/java.desktop/java/beans/package-summary.html[javabeans].

One quite important class in the beans package is the `BeanWrapper` interface and its
corresponding implementation (`BeanWrapperImpl`). As quoted from the javadoc, the
`BeanWrapper` offers functionality to set and get property values (individually or in
bulk), get property descriptors, and query properties to determine if they are
readable or writable. Also, the `BeanWrapper` offers support for nested properties,
enabling the setting of properties on sub-properties to an unlimited depth. The
`BeanWrapper` also supports the ability to add standard JavaBeans `PropertyChangeListeners`
and `VetoableChangeListeners`, without the need for supporting code in the target class.
Last but not least, the `BeanWrapper` provides support for setting indexed properties.
The `BeanWrapper` usually is not used by application code directly but is used by the
`DataBinder` and the `BeanFactory`.

The way the `BeanWrapper` works is partly indicated by its name: it wraps a bean to
perform actions on that bean, such as setting and retrieving properties.



[[beans-beans-conventions]]
=== Setting and Getting Basic and Nested Properties

Setting and getting properties is done through the `setPropertyValue` and
`getPropertyValue` overloaded method variants of `BeanWrapper`. See their Javadoc for
details. The below table shows some examples of these conventions:

[[beans-beans-conventions-properties-tbl]]
.Examples of properties
|===
| Expression| Explanation

| `name`
| Indicates the property `name` that corresponds to the `getName()` or `isName()`
  and `setName(..)` methods.

| `account.name`
| Indicates the nested property `name` of the property `account` that corresponds to
  (for example) the `getAccount().setName()` or `getAccount().getName()` methods.

| `account[2]`
| Indicates the _third_ element of the indexed property `account`. Indexed properties
  can be of type `array`, `list`, or other naturally ordered collection.

| `account[COMPANYNAME]`
| Indicates the value of the map entry indexed by the `COMPANYNAME` key of the `account` `Map`
  property.
|===

(This next section is not vitally important to you if you do not plan to work with
the `BeanWrapper` directly. If you use only the `DataBinder` and the `BeanFactory`
and their default implementations, you should skip ahead to the
xref:core/validation/beans-beans.adoc#beans-beans-conversion[section on `PropertyEditors`].)

The following two example classes use the `BeanWrapper` to get and set
properties:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class Company {

  private String name;
  private Employee managingDirector;

  public String getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public Employee getManagingDirector() {
    return this.managingDirector;
  }

  public void setManagingDirector(Employee managingDirector) {
    this.managingDirector = managingDirector;
  }
}

  }

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public float getSalary() {
    return salary;
  }

  public void setSalary(float salary) {
    this.salary = salary;
  }
}
----

The following code snippets show some examples of how to retrieve and manipulate some of
the properties of instantiated ``Company``s and ``Employee``s:

Java::

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
BeanWrapper company = new BeanWrapperImpl(new Company());
// setting the company name..
company.setPropertyValue("name", "Some Company Inc.");
// ... can also be done like this:
PropertyValue value = new PropertyValue("name", "Some Company Inc.");
company.setPropertyValue(value);

// ok, let's create the director and tie it to the company:
BeanWrapper jim = new BeanWrapperImpl(new Employee());
jim.setPropertyValue("name", "Jim Stravinsky");
company.setPropertyValue("managingDirector", jim.getWrappedInstance());

// retrieving the salary of the managingDirector through the company
Float salary = (Float) company.getPropertyValue("managingDirector.salary");

[[beans-beans-conversion]]
== ``PropertyEditor``'s

Infra uses the concept of a `PropertyEditor` to effect the conversion between an
`Object` and a `String`. It can be handy
to represent properties in a different way than the object itself. For example, a `Date`
can be represented in a human readable way (as the `String`: `'2007-14-09'`), while
we can still convert the human readable form back to the original date (or, even
better, convert any date entered in a human readable form back to `Date` objects). This
behavior can be achieved by registering custom editors of type
`java.beans.PropertyEditor`. Registering custom editors on a `BeanWrapper` or,
alternatively, in a specific IoC container (as mentioned in the previous chapter), gives it
the knowledge of how to convert properties to the desired type. For more about
`PropertyEditor`, see {java-api}/java.desktop/java/beans/package-summary.html[the javadoc of the `java.beans` package from Oracle].

A couple of examples where property editing is used in Infra:

* Setting properties on beans is done by using `PropertyEditor` implementations.
  When you use `String` as the value of a property of some bean that you declare
  in an XML file, Infra (if the setter of the corresponding property has a `Class`
  parameter) uses `ClassEditor` to try to resolve the parameter to a `Class` object.
* Parsing HTTP request parameters in Infra MVC framework is done by using all kinds
  of `PropertyEditor` implementations that you can manually bind in all subclasses of the
  `CommandController`.

Infra has a number of built-in `PropertyEditor` implementations to make life easy.
They are all located in the `infra.beans.propertyeditors`
package. Most, (but not all, as indicated in the following table) are, by default, registered by
`BeanWrapperImpl`. Where the property editor is configurable in some fashion, you can
still register your own variant to override the default one. The following table describes
the various `PropertyEditor` implementations that Infra provides:

[[beans-beans-property-editors-tbl]]
.Built-in `PropertyEditor` Implementations
[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| Class| Explanation

| `ByteArrayPropertyEditor`
| Editor for byte arrays. Converts strings to their corresponding byte
  representations. Registered by default by `BeanWrapperImpl`.

| `ClassEditor`
| Parses Strings that represent classes to actual classes and vice-versa. When a
  class is not found, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. By default, registered by
  `BeanWrapperImpl`.

| `CustomBooleanEditor`
| Customizable property editor for `Boolean` properties. By default, registered by
  `BeanWrapperImpl` but can be overridden by registering a custom instance of it as a
  custom editor.

| `CustomCollectionEditor`
| Property editor for collections, converting any source `Collection` to a given target
  `Collection` type.

| `CustomDateEditor`
| Customizable property editor for `java.util.Date`, supporting a custom `DateFormat`. NOT
  registered by default. Must be user-registered with the appropriate format as needed.

| `CustomNumberEditor`
| Customizable property editor for any `Number` subclass, such as `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, or
  `Double`. By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl` but can be overridden by
  registering a custom instance of it as a custom editor.

| `FileEditor`
| Resolves strings to `java.io.File` objects. By default, registered by
  `BeanWrapperImpl`.

| `InputStreamEditor`
| One-way property editor that can take a string and produce (through an
  intermediate `ResourceEditor` and `Resource`) an `InputStream` so that `InputStream`
  properties may be directly set as strings. Note that the default usage does not close
  the `InputStream` for you. By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl`.

| `LocaleEditor`
| Can resolve strings to `Locale` objects and vice-versa (the string format is
  `[language]\_[country]_[variant]`, same as the `toString()` method of
  `Locale`). Also accepts spaces as separators, as an alternative to underscores.
  By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl`.

| `PatternEditor`
| Can resolve strings to `java.util.regex.Pattern` objects and vice-versa.

| `PropertiesEditor`
| Can convert strings (formatted with the format defined in the javadoc of the
  `java.util.Properties` class) to `Properties` objects. By default, registered
  by `BeanWrapperImpl`.

| `StringTrimmerEditor`
| Property editor that trims strings. Optionally allows transforming an empty string
  into a `null` value. NOT registered by default -- must be user-registered.

| `URLEditor`
| Can resolve a string representation of a URL to an actual `URL` object.
  By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl`.
|===

Infra uses the `java.beans.PropertyEditorManager` to set the search path for property
editors that might be needed. The search path also includes `sun.bean.editors`, which
includes `PropertyEditor` implementations for types such as `Font`, `Color`, and most of
the primitive types. Note also that the standard JavaBeans infrastructure
automatically discovers `PropertyEditor` classes (without you having to register them
explicitly) if they are in the same package as the class they handle and have the same
name as that class, with `Editor` appended. For example, one could have the following
class and package structure, which would be sufficient for the `SomethingEditor` class to be
recognized and used as the `PropertyEditor` for `Something`-typed properties.

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
com
  chank
    pop
      Something
      SomethingEditor // the PropertyEditor for the Something class
----

Note that you can also use the standard `BeanInfo` JavaBeans mechanism here as well
(described to some extent
{java-tutorial}/javabeans/advanced/customization.html[here]). The
following example uses the `BeanInfo` mechanism to explicitly register one or more
`PropertyEditor` instances with the properties of an associated class:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
com
  chank
    pop
      Something
      SomethingBeanInfo // the BeanInfo for the Something class
----

The following Java source code for the referenced `SomethingBeanInfo` class
associates a `CustomNumberEditor` with the `age` property of the `Something` class:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
public class SomethingBeanInfo extends SimpleBeanInfo {

  public PropertyDescriptor[] getPropertyDescriptors() {
    try {
      final PropertyEditor numberPE = new CustomNumberEditor(Integer.class, true);
      PropertyDescriptor ageDescriptor = new PropertyDescriptor("age", Something.class) {
        @Override
        public PropertyEditor createPropertyEditor(Object bean) {
          return numberPE;
        }
      };
      return new PropertyDescriptor[] { ageDescriptor };
    }
    catch (IntrospectionException ex) {
      throw new Error(ex.toString());
    }
  }
}
----

======


[[beans-beans-conversion-customeditor-registration]]
=== Custom ``PropertyEditor``'s

When setting bean properties as string values, a Infra IoC container ultimately uses
standard JavaBeans `PropertyEditor` implementations to convert these strings to the complex type of the
property. Infra pre-registers a number of custom `PropertyEditor` implementations (for example, to
convert a class name expressed as a string into a `Class` object). Additionally,
Java's standard JavaBeans `PropertyEditor` lookup mechanism lets a `PropertyEditor`
for a class be named appropriately and placed in the same package as the class
for which it provides support, so that it can be found automatically.

If there is a need to register other custom `PropertyEditors`, several mechanisms are
available. The most manual approach, which is not normally convenient or
recommended, is to use the `registerCustomEditor()` method of the
`ConfigurableBeanFactory` interface, assuming you have a `BeanFactory` reference.
Another (slightly more convenient) mechanism is to use a special bean factory
post-processor called `CustomEditorConfigurer`. Although you can use bean factory post-processors
with `BeanFactory` implementations, the `CustomEditorConfigurer` has a
nested property setup, so we strongly recommend that you use it with the
`ApplicationContext`, where you can deploy it in similar fashion to any other bean and
where it can be automatically detected and applied.

Note that all bean factories and application contexts automatically use a number of
built-in property editors, through their use of a `BeanWrapper` to
handle property conversions. The standard property editors that the `BeanWrapper`
registers are listed in the xref:core/validation/beans-beans.adoc#beans-beans-conversion[previous section].
Additionally, ``ApplicationContext``s also override or add additional editors to handle
resource lookups in a manner appropriate to the specific application context type.

Standard JavaBeans `PropertyEditor` instances are used to convert property values
expressed as strings to the actual complex type of the property. You can use
`CustomEditorConfigurer`, a bean factory post-processor, to conveniently add
support for additional `PropertyEditor` instances to an `ApplicationContext`.

Consider the following example, which defines a user class called `ExoticType` and
another class called `DependsOnExoticType`, which needs `ExoticType` set as a property:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary",chomp="-packages"]
----
package example;

public class ExoticType {

  private String name;

  public ExoticType(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

public class DependsOnExoticType {

  private ExoticType type;

  public void setType(ExoticType type) {
    this.type = type;
  }
}
----
======

When things are properly set up, we want to be able to assign the type property as a
string, which a `PropertyEditor` converts into an actual
`ExoticType` instance. The following bean definition shows how to set up this relationship:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="sample" class="example.DependsOnExoticType">
  <property name="type" value="aNameForExoticType"/>
</bean>
----

The `PropertyEditor` implementation could look similar to the following:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary",chomp="-packages"]
----
	package example;

	import java.beans.PropertyEditorSupport;

	// converts string representation to ExoticType object
	public class ExoticTypeEditor extends PropertyEditorSupport {

		public void setAsText(String text) {
			setValue(new ExoticType(text.toUpperCase()));
		}
	}
----
======

Finally, the following example shows how to use `CustomEditorConfigurer` to register the new `PropertyEditor` with the
`ApplicationContext`, which will then be able to use it as needed:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean class="infra.beans.factory.config.CustomEditorConfigurer">
  <property name="customEditors">
    <map>
      <entry key="example.ExoticType" value="example.ExoticTypeEditor"/>
    </map>
  </property>
</bean>
----

[[beans-beans-conversion-customeditor-registration-per]]
=== `PropertyEditorRegistrar`

Another mechanism for registering property editors with the Infra container is to
create and use a `PropertyEditorRegistrar`. This interface is particularly useful when
you need to use the same set of property editors in several different situations.
You can write a corresponding registrar and reuse it in each case.
`PropertyEditorRegistrar` instances work in conjunction with an interface called
`PropertyEditorRegistry`, an interface that is implemented by the Infra `BeanWrapper`
(and `DataBinder`). `PropertyEditorRegistrar` instances are particularly convenient
when used in conjunction with `CustomEditorConfigurer` (described
xref:core/validation/beans-beans.adoc#beans-beans-conversion-customeditor-registration[here]), which exposes a property
called `setPropertyEditorRegistrars(..)`. `PropertyEditorRegistrar` instances added
to a `CustomEditorConfigurer` in this fashion can easily be shared with `DataBinder` and
Web MVC controllers. Furthermore, it avoids the need for synchronization on custom
editors: A `PropertyEditorRegistrar` is expected to create fresh `PropertyEditor`
instances for each bean creation attempt.

The following example shows how to create your own `PropertyEditorRegistrar` implementation:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary",chomp="-packages"]
----
package com.foo.editors.spring;

public final class CustomPropertyEditorRegistrar implements PropertyEditorRegistrar {

  public void registerCustomEditors(PropertyEditorRegistry registry) {

    // it is expected that new PropertyEditor instances are created
    registry.registerCustomEditor(ExoticType.class, new ExoticTypeEditor());

    // you could register as many custom property editors as are required here...
  }
}
----

======

See also the `infra.beans.support.ResourceEditorRegistrar` for an example
`PropertyEditorRegistrar` implementation. Notice how in its implementation of the
`registerCustomEditors(..)` method, it creates new instances of each property editor.

The next example shows how to configure a `CustomEditorConfigurer` and inject an instance
of our `CustomPropertyEditorRegistrar` into it:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean class="infra.beans.factory.config.CustomEditorConfigurer">
  <property name="propertyEditorRegistrars">
    <list>
      <ref bean="customPropertyEditorRegistrar"/>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>

<bean id="customPropertyEditorRegistrar"
  class="com.foo.editors.spring.CustomPropertyEditorRegistrar"/>
----

Finally (and in a bit of a departure from the focus of this chapter) for those of you
using xref:web/webmvc.adoc#mvc[Infra MVC web framework], using a `PropertyEditorRegistrar` in
conjunction with data-binding web controllers can be very convenient. The following
example uses a `PropertyEditorRegistrar` in the implementation of an `@InitBinder` method:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Controller
public class RegisterUserController {

  private final PropertyEditorRegistrar customPropertyEditorRegistrar;

  RegisterUserController(PropertyEditorRegistrar propertyEditorRegistrar) {
    this.customPropertyEditorRegistrar = propertyEditorRegistrar;
  }

  @InitBinder
  void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
    this.customPropertyEditorRegistrar.registerCustomEditors(binder);
  }

  // other methods related to registering a User
}
----
======

This style of `PropertyEditor` registration can lead to concise code (the implementation
of the `@InitBinder` method is only one line long) and lets common `PropertyEditor`
registration code be encapsulated in a class and then shared amongst as many controllers
as needed.
