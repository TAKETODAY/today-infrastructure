[[core-convert]]
= Infra Type Conversion

The `core.convert` package provides a general type conversion system. The system defines
an SPI to implement type conversion logic and an API to perform type conversions at
runtime. Within a Infra container, you can use this system as an alternative to
`PropertyEditor` implementations to convert externalized bean property value strings to
the required property types. You can also use the public API anywhere in your application
where type conversion is needed.



[[core-convert-Converter-API]]
== Converter SPI

The SPI to implement type conversion logic is simple and strongly typed, as the following
interface definition shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",chomp="-packages"]
----
package cn.taketoday.core.convert.converter;

public interface Converter<S, T> {

  T convert(S source);
}
----

To create your own converter, implement the `Converter` interface and parameterize `S`
as the type you are converting from and `T` as the type you are converting to. You can also transparently apply such a
converter if a collection or array of `S` needs to be
converted to an array or collection of `T`, provided that a delegating array or collection
converter has been registered as well (which `DefaultConversionService` does by default).

For each call to `convert(S)`, the source argument is guaranteed to not be null. Your
`Converter` may throw any unchecked exception if conversion fails. Specifically, it should throw an
`IllegalArgumentException` to report an invalid source value.
Take care to ensure that your `Converter` implementation is thread-safe.

Several converter implementations are provided in the `core.convert.support` package as
a convenience. These include converters from strings to numbers and other common types.
The following listing shows the `StringToInteger` class, which is a typical `Converter` implementation:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",chomp="-packages"]
----
package cn.taketoday.core.convert.support;

final class StringToInteger implements Converter<String, Integer> {

  public Integer convert(String source) {
    return Integer.valueOf(source);
  }
}
----



[[core-convert-ConverterFactory-SPI]]
== Using `ConverterFactory`

When you need to centralize the conversion logic for an entire class hierarchy
(for example, when converting from `String` to `Enum` objects), you can implement
`ConverterFactory`, as the following example shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",chomp="-packages"]
----
package cn.taketoday.core.convert.converter;

public interface ConverterFactory<S, R> {

  <T extends R> Converter<S, T> getConverter(Class<T> targetType);
}
----

Parameterize S to be the type you are converting from and R to be the base type defining
the __range__ of classes you can convert to. Then implement `getConverter(Class<T>)`,
where T is a subclass of R.

Consider the `StringToEnumConverterFactory` as an example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",chomp="-packages"]
----
package cn.taketoday.core.convert.support;

final class StringToEnumConverterFactory implements ConverterFactory<String, Enum> {

  public <T extends Enum> Converter<String, T> getConverter(Class<T> targetType) {
    return new StringToEnumConverter(targetType);
  }

  private final class StringToEnumConverter<T extends Enum> implements Converter<String, T> {

    private Class<T> enumType;

    public StringToEnumConverter(Class<T> enumType) {
      this.enumType = enumType;
    }

    public T convert(String source) {
      return (T) Enum.valueOf(this.enumType, source.trim());
    }
  }
}
----


[[core-convert-GenericConverter-SPI]]
== Using `GenericConverter`

When you require a sophisticated `Converter` implementation, consider using the
`GenericConverter` interface. With a more flexible but less strongly typed signature
than `Converter`, a `GenericConverter` supports converting between multiple source and
target types. In addition, a `GenericConverter` makes available source and target field
context that you can use when you implement your conversion logic. Such context lets a
type conversion be driven by a field annotation or by generic information declared on a
field signature. The following listing shows the interface definition of `GenericConverter`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",chomp="-packages"]
----
package cn.taketoday.core.convert.converter;

public interface GenericConverter {

  public Set<ConvertiblePair> getConvertibleTypes();

  Object convert(Object source, TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType);
}
----

To implement a `GenericConverter`, have `getConvertibleTypes()` return the supported
source->target type pairs. Then implement `convert(Object, TypeDescriptor,
TypeDescriptor)` to contain your conversion logic. The source `TypeDescriptor` provides
access to the source field that holds the value being converted. The target `TypeDescriptor`
provides access to the target field where the converted value is to be set.

A good example of a `GenericConverter` is a converter that converts between a Java array
and a collection. Such an `ArrayToCollectionConverter` introspects the field that declares
the target collection type to resolve the collection's element type. This lets each
element in the source array be converted to the collection element type before the
collection is set on the target field.

NOTE: Because `GenericConverter` is a more complex SPI interface, you should use
it only when you need it. Favor `Converter` or `ConverterFactory` for basic type
conversion needs.


[[core-convert-ConditionalGenericConverter-SPI]]
=== Using `ConditionalGenericConverter`

Sometimes, you want a `Converter` to run only if a specific condition holds true. For
example, you might want to run a `Converter` only if a specific annotation is present
on the target field, or you might want to run a `Converter` only if a specific method
(such as a `static valueOf` method) is defined on the target class.
`ConditionalGenericConverter` is the union of the `GenericConverter` and
`ConditionalConverter` interfaces that lets you define such custom matching criteria:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface ConditionalConverter {

  boolean matches(TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType);
}

public interface ConditionalGenericConverter extends GenericConverter, ConditionalConverter {
}
----

A good example of a `ConditionalGenericConverter` is an `IdToEntityConverter` that converts
between a persistent entity identifier and an entity reference. Such an `IdToEntityConverter`
might match only if the target entity type declares a static finder method (for example,
`findAccount(Long)`). You might perform such a finder method check in the implementation of
`matches(TypeDescriptor, TypeDescriptor)`.



[[core-convert-ConversionService-API]]
== The `ConversionService` API

`ConversionService` defines a unified API for executing type conversion logic at
runtime. Converters are often run behind the following facade interface:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",chomp="-packages"]
----
package cn.taketoday.core.convert;

public interface ConversionService {

  boolean canConvert(Class<?> sourceType, Class<?> targetType);

  <T> T convert(Object source, Class<T> targetType);

  boolean canConvert(TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType);

  Object convert(Object source, TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType);
}
----

Most `ConversionService` implementations also implement `ConverterRegistry`, which
provides an SPI for registering converters. Internally, a `ConversionService`
implementation delegates to its registered converters to carry out type conversion logic.

A robust `ConversionService` implementation is provided in the `core.convert.support`
package. `GenericConversionService` is the general-purpose implementation suitable for
use in most environments. `ConversionServiceFactory` provides a convenient factory for
creating common `ConversionService` configurations.



[[core-convert-Infra-config]]
== Configuring a `ConversionService`

A `ConversionService` is a stateless object designed to be instantiated at application
startup and then shared between multiple threads. In a Infra application, you typically
configure a `ConversionService` instance for each Infra container (or `ApplicationContext`).
Infra picks up that `ConversionService` and uses it whenever a type
conversion needs to be performed by the framework. You can also inject this
`ConversionService` into any of your beans and invoke it directly.

NOTE: If no `ConversionService` is registered with Infra, the original `PropertyEditor`-based
system is used.

To register a default `ConversionService` with Infra, add the following bean definition
with an `id` of `conversionService`:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="conversionService"
  class="cn.taketoday.context.support.ConversionServiceFactoryBean"/>
----

A default `ConversionService` can convert between strings, numbers, enums, collections,
maps, and other common types. To supplement or override the default converters with your
own custom converters, set the `converters` property. Property values can implement
any of the `Converter`, `ConverterFactory`, or `GenericConverter` interfaces.

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bean id="conversionService"
    class="cn.taketoday.context.support.ConversionServiceFactoryBean">
  <property name="converters">
    <set>
      <bean class="example.MyCustomConverter"/>
    </set>
  </property>
</bean>
----

It is also common to use a `ConversionService` within a Web MVC application. See
xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config/conversion.adoc[Conversion and Formatting] in the Web MVC chapter.

In certain situations, you may wish to apply formatting during conversion. See
xref:core/validation/format.adoc#format-FormatterRegistry-SPI[The `FormatterRegistry` SPI] for details on using `FormattingConversionServiceFactoryBean`.



[[core-convert-programmatic-usage]]
== Using a `ConversionService` Programmatically

To work with a `ConversionService` instance programmatically, you can inject a reference to
it like you would for any other bean. The following example shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
@Service
public class MyService {

  private final ConversionService conversionService;

  public MyService(ConversionService conversionService) {
    this.conversionService = conversionService;
  }

  public void doIt() {
    this.conversionService.convert(...)
  }
}
----

======

For most use cases, you can use the `convert` method that specifies the `targetType`, but it
does not work with more complex types, such as a collection of a parameterized element.
For example, if you want to convert a `List` of `Integer` to a `List` of `String` programmatically,
you need to provide a formal definition of the source and target types.

Fortunately, `TypeDescriptor` provides various options to make doing so straightforward,
as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
DefaultConversionService cs = new DefaultConversionService();

List<Integer> input = ...
cs.convert(input,
  TypeDescriptor.forObject(input), // List<Integer> type descriptor
  TypeDescriptor.collection(List.class, TypeDescriptor.valueOf(String.class)));
----
======

Note that `DefaultConversionService` automatically registers converters that are
appropriate for most environments. This includes collection converters, scalar
converters, and basic `Object`-to-`String` converters. You can register the same converters
with any `ConverterRegistry` by using the static `addDefaultConverters`
method on the `DefaultConversionService` class.

Converters for value types are reused for arrays and collections, so there is
no need to create a specific converter to convert from a `Collection` of `S` to a
`Collection` of `T`, assuming that standard collection handling is appropriate.
