/**
 * Concrete AspectJ cache aspect using Framework's @{@link Cacheable} annotation.
 *
 * <p>When using this aspect, you <i>must</i> annotate the implementation class (and/or
 * methods within that class), <i>not</i> the interface (if any) that the class
 * implements. AspectJ follows Java's rule that annotations on interfaces are <i>not</i>
 * inherited.
 *
 * <p>A {@code @Cacheable} annotation on a class specifies the default caching semantics
 * for the execution of any <b>public</b> operation in the class.
 *
 * <p>A {@code @Cacheable} annotation on a method within the class overrides the default
 * caching semantics given by the class annotation (if present). Any method may be
 * annotated (regardless of visibility). Annotating non-public methods directly is the
 * only way to get caching demarcation for the execution of such operations.
