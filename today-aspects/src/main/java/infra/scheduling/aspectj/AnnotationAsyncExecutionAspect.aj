/**
 * Aspect to route methods based on Framework's {@link Async} annotation.
 *
 * <p>This aspect routes methods marked with the {@link Async} annotation as well as methods
 * in classes marked with the same. Any method expected to be routed asynchronously must
 * return either {@code void}, {@link Future}, or a subtype of {@link Future} (in particular,
 * Infra {@link infra.util.concurrent.Future}). This aspect,
 * therefore, will produce a compile-time error for methods that violate this constraint
 * on the return type. If, however, a class marked with {@code @Async} contains a method
 * that violates this constraint, it produces only a warning.
 *
 * <p>This aspect needs to be injected with an implementation of a task-oriented
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} to activate it for a specific thread pool,
 * or with a {@link infra.beans.factory.BeanFactory} for default
 * executor lookup. Otherwise it will simply delegate all calls synchronously.
