/**
 * Test annotation which indicates that the
 * {@link infra.context.ApplicationContext ApplicationContext}
 * associated with a test is <em>dirty</em> and should therefore be closed
 * and removed from the context cache.
 *
 * <p>Use this annotation if a test has modified the context &mdash; for
 * example, by modifying the state of a singleton bean, modifying the state
 * of an embedded database, etc. Subsequent tests that request the same
 * context will be supplied a new context.
 *
 * <p>{@code @DirtiesContext} may be used as a class-level and method-level
 * annotation within the same class or class hierarchy. In such scenarios, the
 * {@code ApplicationContext} will be marked as <em>dirty</em> before or
 * after any such annotated method as well as before or after the current test
 * class, depending on the configured {@link #methodMode} and {@link #classMode}.
 *
 * <p>This annotation may be used as a <em>meta-annotation</em> to create custom
 * <em>composed annotations</em>.
 *
 * <p> this annotation will be inherited from an
 * enclosing test class by default. See
 * {@link NestedTestConfiguration @NestedTestConfiguration}
 * for details.
 *
 * <h3>Supported Test Phases</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Before current test class</strong>: when declared at the class
 * level with class mode set to {@link ClassMode#BEFORE_CLASS BEFORE_CLASS}</li>
 * <li><strong>Before each test method in current test class</strong>: when
 * declared at the class level with class mode set to
 * {@link ClassMode#BEFORE_EACH_TEST_METHOD BEFORE_EACH_TEST_METHOD}</li>
 * <li><strong>Before current test method</strong>: when declared at the
 * method level with method mode set to
 * {@link MethodMode#BEFORE_METHOD BEFORE_METHOD}</li>
 * <li><strong>After current test method</strong>: when declared at the
 * method level with method mode set to
 * {@link MethodMode#AFTER_METHOD AFTER_METHOD}</li>
 * <li><strong>After each test method in current test class</strong>: when
 * declared at the class level with class mode set to
 * {@link ClassMode#AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD}</li>
 * <li><strong>After current test class</strong>: when declared at the
 * class level with class mode set to
 * {@link ClassMode#AFTER_CLASS AFTER_CLASS}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code BEFORE_*} modes are supported by the
 * {@link DirtiesContextBeforeModesTestExecutionListener DirtiesContextBeforeModesTestExecutionListener};
 * {@code AFTER_*} modes are supported by the
