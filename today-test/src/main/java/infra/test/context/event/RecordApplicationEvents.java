/**
 * {@code @RecordApplicationEvents} is a class-level annotation that is used to
 * instruct the <em>Infra TestContext Framework</em> to record all
 * {@linkplain infra.context.ApplicationEvent application events}
 * that are published in the {@link infra.context.ApplicationContext
 * ApplicationContext} during the execution of a single test, either from the
 * test thread or its descendants.
 *
 * <p>The recorded events can be accessed via the {@link ApplicationEvents} API
 * within your tests.
 *
 * <p>This annotation may be used as a <em>meta-annotation</em> to create custom
 * <em>composed annotations</em>.
 *
 * <p>This annotation will be inherited from an enclosing test class by default. See
 * {@link NestedTestConfiguration @NestedTestConfiguration}
 * for details.
