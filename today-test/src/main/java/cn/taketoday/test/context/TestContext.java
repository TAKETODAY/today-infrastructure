 * to implement a <em>copy constructor</em> in order to allow the immutable state
 * and attributes of a {@code TestContext} to be used as a template for additional
 * contexts created for parallel test execution. The copy constructor must accept a
 * single argument of the type of the concrete implementation. Any implementation
 * that does not provide a copy constructor will likely fail in an environment
