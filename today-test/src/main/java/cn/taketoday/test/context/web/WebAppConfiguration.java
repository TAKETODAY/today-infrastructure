/**
 * {@code @WebAppConfiguration} is a class-level annotation that is used to
 * declare that the {@code ApplicationContext} loaded for an integration test
 * should be a {@link cn.taketoday.web.context.WebApplicationContext
 * WebApplicationContext}.
 *
 * <p>The presence of {@code @WebAppConfiguration} on a test class indicates that
 * a {@code WebApplicationContext} should be loaded for the test using a default
 * for the path to the root of the web application. To override the default,
 * specify an explicit resource path via the {@link #value} attribute.
 *
 * <p>Note that {@code @WebAppConfiguration} must be used in conjunction with
 * {@link ContextConfiguration @ContextConfiguration},
 * either within a single test class or within a test class hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>This annotation may be used as a <em>meta-annotation</em> to create custom
 * <em>composed annotations</em>.
 *
 * <p>As of Spring Framework 5.3, this annotation will be inherited from an
 * enclosing test class by default. See
 * {@link NestedTestConfiguration @NestedTestConfiguration}
 * for details.
