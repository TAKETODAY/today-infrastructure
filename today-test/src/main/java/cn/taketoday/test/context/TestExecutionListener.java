/**
 * {@code TestExecutionListener} defines a <em>listener</em> API for reacting to
 * test execution events published by the {@link TestContextManager} with which
 * the listener is registered.
 *
 * <p>Note that not all testing frameworks support all lifecycle callbacks defined
 * in this API. For example, {@link #beforeTestExecution} and
 * {@link #afterTestExecution} are not supported in conjunction with JUnit 4 when
 * using the {@link SpringMethodRule
 * SpringMethodRule}.
 *
 * <p>This interface provides empty {@code default} implementations for all methods.
 * Concrete implementations can therefore choose to override only those methods
 * suitable for the task at hand.
 *
 * <p>Concrete implementations must provide a {@code public} no-args constructor,
 * so that listeners can be instantiated transparently by tools and configuration
 * mechanisms.
 *
 * <p>Implementations may optionally declare the position in which they should
 * be ordered among the chain of default listeners via the
 * {@link cn.taketoday.core.Ordered Ordered} interface or
 * {@link cn.taketoday.core.annotation.Order @Order} annotation. See
 * {@link TestContextBootstrapper#getTestExecutionListeners()} for details.
 *
 * <p>Spring provides the following out-of-the-box implementations (all of
 * which implement {@code Ordered}):
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ServletTestExecutionListener
 * ServletTestExecutionListener}</li>
 * <li>{@link DirtiesContextBeforeModesTestExecutionListener
 * DirtiesContextBeforeModesTestExecutionListener}</li>
 * <li>{@link ApplicationEventsTestExecutionListener
 * ApplicationEventsTestExecutionListener}</li>
 * <li>{@link DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener
 * DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener}</li>
 * <li>{@link DirtiesContextTestExecutionListener
 * DirtiesContextTestExecutionListener}</li>
 * <li>{@link TransactionalTestExecutionListener
