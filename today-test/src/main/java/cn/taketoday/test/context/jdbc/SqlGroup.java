 * Container annotation that aggregates several {@link Sql @Sql} annotations.

 * Can also be used in conjunction with Java 8's support for repeatable
 * annotations, where {@code @Sql} can simply be declared several times on the
 * same class or method, implicitly generating this container annotation.
 *
 * <p>This annotation may be used as a <em>meta-annotation</em> to create custom
 * <em>composed annotations</em>.
