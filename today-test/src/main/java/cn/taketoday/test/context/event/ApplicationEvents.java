 * <ul>
 * <li>Ensure that your test class is annotated or meta-annotated with
 * {@link RecordApplicationEvents @RecordApplicationEvents}.</li>
 * <li>Ensure that the {@link ApplicationEventsTestExecutionListener} is
 * registered. Note, however, that it is registered by default and only needs
 * to be manually registered if you have custom configuration via
 * {@link TestExecutionListeners @TestExecutionListeners}
 * that does not include the default listeners.</li>
 * <li>Annotate a field of type {@code ApplicationEvents} with
 * {@link cn.taketoday.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired @Autowired} and
 * use that instance of {@code ApplicationEvents} in your test and lifecycle methods.</li>
 * <li>With JUnit Jupiter, you may optionally declare a parameter of type
 * {@code ApplicationEvents} in a test or lifecycle method as an alternative to
 * an {@code @Autowired} field in the test class.</li>
