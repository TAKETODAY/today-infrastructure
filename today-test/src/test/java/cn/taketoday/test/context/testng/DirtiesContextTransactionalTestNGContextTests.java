/**
 * <p>
 * TestNG based integration test to assess the claim in <a
 * href="https://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/spring/browse/SPR-3880"
 * target="_blank">SPR-3880</a> that a &quot;context marked dirty using
 * {@link DirtiesContext &#064;DirtiesContext} in [a] TestNG based test is not
 * reloaded in subsequent tests&quot;.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After careful analysis, it turns out that the {@link ApplicationContext} was
 * in fact reloaded; however, due to how the test instance was instrumented with
 * the {@link TestContextManager} in {@link AbstractTestNGContextTests},
 * dependency injection was not being performed on the test instance between
 * individual tests. DirtiesContextTransactionalTestNGSpringContextTests
 * therefore verifies the expected behavior and correct semantics.
