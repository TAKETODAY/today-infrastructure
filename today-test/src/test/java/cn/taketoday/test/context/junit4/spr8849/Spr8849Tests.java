/**
 * Test suite to investigate claims raised in
 * <a href="https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8849">SPR-8849</a>.
 *
 * <h3>Work Around</h3>
 * <p>By using a SpEL expression to generate a random {@code database-name}
 * for the embedded database (see {@code datasource-config.xml}), we ensure
 * that each {@code ApplicationContext} that imports the common configuration
 * will create an embedded database with a unique name.
 *
 * <p>To reproduce the problem mentioned in SPR-8849, delete the declaration
 * of the {@code database-name} attribute of the embedded database in
 * {@code datasource-config.xml} and run this <em>suite</em>.
 *
 * <h3>Solution</h3>
 * <p>As of Spring 4.2, a proper solution is possible thanks to SPR-8849.
 * {@link TestClass3} and {@link TestClass4} both import
 * {@code datasource-config-with-auto-generated-db-name.xml} which makes
 * use of the new {@code generate-name} attribute of {@code <jdbc:embedded-database>}.
