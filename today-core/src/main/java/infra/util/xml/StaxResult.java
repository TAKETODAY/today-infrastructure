/**
 * Implementation of the {@code Result} tagging interface for StAX writers. Can be constructed with
 * an {@code XMLEventConsumer} or an {@code XMLStreamWriter}.
 *
 * <p>This class is necessary because there is no implementation of {@code Source} for StaxReaders
 * in JAXP 1.3. There is a {@code StAXResult} in JAXP 1.4 (JDK 1.6), but this class is kept around
 * for backwards compatibility reasons.
 *
 * <p>Even though {@code StaxResult} extends from {@code SAXResult}, calling the methods of
 * {@code SAXResult} is <strong>not supported</strong>. In general, the only supported operation
 * on this class is to use the {@code ContentHandler} obtained via {@link #getHandler()} to parse an
 * input source using an {@code XMLReader}. Calling {@link #setHandler(ContentHandler)}
 * or {@link #setLexicalHandler(LexicalHandler)} will result in
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}s.
