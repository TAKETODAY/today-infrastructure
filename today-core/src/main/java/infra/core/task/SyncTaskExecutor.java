/**

 *
 * <p>Execution in the calling thread does have the advantage of participating
 * in it's thread context, for example the thread context class loader or the
 * thread's current transaction association. That said, in many cases,
 * asynchronous execution will be preferable: choose an asynchronous
 * {@code TaskExecutor} instead for such scenarios.
