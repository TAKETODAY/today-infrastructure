/**
 * Strategy for types that access elements of specific target classes.
 *
 * <p>This interface places no restrictions on what constitutes an element.
 *
 * <p>A targeted accessor can specify a set of target classes for which it should
 * be called. However, if it returns {@code null} or an empty array from
 * {@link #getSpecificTargetClasses()}, it will typically be called for all
 * access operations and given a chance to determine if it supports a concrete
 * access attempt.
 *
 * <p>Targeted accessors are considered to be ordered, and each will be called
 * in turn. The only rule that affects the call order is that any accessor which
 * specifies explicit support for a given target type via
 * {@link #getSpecificTargetClasses()} will be called first, before other generic
 * accessors that do not specify support for explicit target types. In addition,
 * accessors that support the exact target type will be called before accessors
 * that support a supertype of the target type.
