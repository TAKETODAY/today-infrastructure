/**
 * A {@link MethodVisitor} adapter to sort the exception handlers. The handlers are sorted in a
 * method innermost-to-outermost. This allows the programmer to add handlers without worrying about
 * ordering them correctly with respect to existing, in-code handlers.
 *
 * <p>Behavior is only defined for properly-nested handlers. If any "try" blocks overlap (something
 * that isn't possible in Java code) then this may not do what you want. In fact, this adapter just
 * sorts by the length of the "try" block, taking advantage of the fact that a given try block must
 * be larger than any block it contains).
