<body>
Provides ASM visitors that can be useful for programming and
debugging purposes. These class visitors are normally not used by applications
at runtime. This is why they are bundled in an optional <code>asm-util.jar</code>
library that is separated from (but requires) the <code>asm.jar</code> library,
which contains the core ASM framework.

@since ASM 1.3.2
