/**
 * A common annotation to declare that annotated elements can be {@code null} under
 * some circumstance.
 *
 * <p>Leverages JSR-305 meta-annotations to indicate nullability in Java to common
 * tools with JSR-305 support.
 *
 * <p>Should be used at parameter, return value, and field level. Methods override should
 * repeat parent {@code @Nullable} annotations unless they behave differently.
