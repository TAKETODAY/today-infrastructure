/**
 * An annotation which marks a {@link java.util.Collection} or {@link java.util.Map} type
 * as unmodifiable. A collection or a map is unmodifiable if any mutator methods
 * (e.g. {@link java.util.Collection#add(Object)}) throw exception or have no effect,
 * and the object references stored as collection elements, map keys, and map values
 * are never changed. The referenced objects themselves still could be changed if they
 * are mutable.
