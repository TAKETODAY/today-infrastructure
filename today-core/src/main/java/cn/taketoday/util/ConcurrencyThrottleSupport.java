/**
 * Support class for throttling concurrent access to a specific resource.
 *
 * <p>Designed for use as a base class, with the subclass invoking
 * the {@link #beforeAccess()} and {@link #afterAccess()} methods at
 * appropriate points of its workflow. Note that {@code afterAccess}
 * should usually be called in a finally block!
 *
 * <p>The default concurrency limit of this support class is -1
 * ("unbounded concurrency"). Subclasses may override this default;
 * check the javadoc of the concrete class that you're using.
