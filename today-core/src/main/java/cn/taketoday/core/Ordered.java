/**
 * {@code Ordered} is an interface that can be implemented by objects that
 * should be <em>orderable</em>, for example in a {@code Collection}.
 *
 * <p>The actual {@link #getOrder() order} can be interpreted as prioritization,
 * with the first object (with the lowest order value) having the highest
 * priority.
 *
 * <p>Note that there is also a <em>priority</em> marker for this interface:
 * {@link PriorityOrdered}. Consult the Javadoc for {@code PriorityOrdered} for
 * details on how {@code PriorityOrdered} objects are ordered relative to
 * <em>plain</em> {@link Ordered} objects.
 *
 * <p>Consult the Javadoc for {@link OrderComparator} for details on the
 * sort semantics for non-ordered objects.
