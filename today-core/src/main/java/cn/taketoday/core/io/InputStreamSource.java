/**
 * Simple interface for objects that are sources for an {@link InputStream}.
 *
 * <p>This is the base interface for Infra more extensive {@link Resource} interface.
 *
 * <p>For single-use streams, {@link InputStreamResource} can be used for any
 * given {@code InputStream}. Infra {@link ByteArrayResource} or any
 * file-based {@code Resource} implementation can be used as a concrete
 * instance, allowing one to read the underlying content stream multiple times.
 * This makes this interface useful as an abstract content source for mail
 * attachments, for example.
