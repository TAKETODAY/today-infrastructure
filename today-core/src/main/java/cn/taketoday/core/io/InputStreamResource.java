/**
 * {@link Resource} implementation for a given {@link InputStream} or a given
 * {@link InputStreamSource} (which can be supplied as a lambda expression)
 * for a lazy {@link InputStream} on demand.
 *
 * <p>Should only be used if no other specific {@code Resource} implementation
 * is applicable. In particular, prefer {@link ByteArrayResource} or any of the
 * file-based {@code Resource} implementations if possible. If you need to obtain
 * a custom stream multiple times, use a custom {@link AbstractResource} subclass
 * with a corresponding {@code getInputStream()} implementation.
 *
 * <p>In contrast to other {@code Resource} implementations, this is a descriptor
 * for an <i>already opened</i> resource - therefore returning {@code true} from
 * {@link #isOpen()}. Do not use an {@code InputStreamResource} if you need to keep
 * the resource descriptor somewhere, or if you need to read from a stream multiple
 * times. This also applies when constructed with an {@code InputStreamSource}
 * which lazily obtains the stream but only allows for single access as well.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE: This class does not provide an independent {@link #contentLength()}
 * implementation: Any such call will consume the given {@code InputStream}!</b>
 * Consider overriding {@code #contentLength()} with a custom implementation if
 * possible. For any other purpose, it is not recommended to extend from this
 * class; this is particularly true when used with Spring's web resource rendering
 * which specifically skips {@code #contentLength()} for this exact class only.
