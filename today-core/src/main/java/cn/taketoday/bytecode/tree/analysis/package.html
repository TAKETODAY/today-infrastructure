  <title>Package cn.taketoday.bytecode.tree.analysis</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
  Provides a framework for static code analysis based on the asm.tree package.
</p>

<p>
  Basic usage:
</p>

<pre>
ClassReader classReader = new ClassReader(bytecode);
ClassNode classNode = new ClassNode();
classReader.accept(classNode, ClassReader.SKIP_DEBUG);

for (MethodNode method : classNode.methods) {
  if (method.instructions.size() > 0) {
    Analyzer analyzer = new Analyzer(new BasicInterpreter());
    analyzer.analyze(classNode.name, method);
    Frame[] frames = analyzer.getFrames();
    // Elements of the frames array now contains info for each instruction
    // from the analyzed method. BasicInterpreter creates BasicValue, that
    // is using simplified type system that distinguishes the UNINITIALZED,
    // INT, FLOAT, LONG, DOUBLE, REFERENCE and RETURNADDRESS types.
    ...
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
  @since ASM 1.4.3
