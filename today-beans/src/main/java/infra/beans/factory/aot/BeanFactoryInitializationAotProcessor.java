/**
 * AOT processor that makes bean factory initialization contributions by
 * processing {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory} instances.
 *
 * <p>{@code BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor} implementations may be
 * registered in a {@value AotServices#FACTORIES_RESOURCE_LOCATION} resource or
 * as a bean.
 *
 * <p>Using this interface on a registered bean will cause the bean <em>and</em>
 * all of its dependencies to be initialized during AOT processing. We generally
 * recommend that this interface is only used with infrastructure beans such as
 * {@link BeanFactoryPostProcessor} which have limited dependencies and are
 * already initialized early in the bean factory lifecycle. If such a bean is
 * registered using a factory method, make sure to make it {@code static} so
 * that its enclosing class does not have to be initialized.
 *
 * <p>A component that implements this interface is not contributed.
