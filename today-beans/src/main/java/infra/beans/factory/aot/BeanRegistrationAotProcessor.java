/**
 * AOT processor that makes bean registration contributions by processing
 * {@link RegisteredBean} instances.
 *
 * <p>{@code BeanRegistrationAotProcessor} implementations may be registered in
 * a {@value AotServices#FACTORIES_RESOURCE_LOCATION} resource or as a bean.
 *
 * <p>Using this interface on a registered bean will cause the bean <em>and</em>
 * all of its dependencies to be initialized during AOT processing. We generally
 * recommend that this interface is only used with infrastructure beans such as
 * {@link BeanPostProcessor} which have limited dependencies and are already
 * initialized early in the bean factory lifecycle. If such a bean is registered
 * using a factory method, make sure to make it {@code static} so that its
 * enclosing class does not have to be initialized.
 *
 * <p>An AOT processor replaces its usual runtime behavior by an optimized
 * arrangement, usually in generated code. For that reason, a component that
 * implements this interface is not contributed by default. If a component that
 * implements this interface still needs to be invoked at runtime,
 * {@link #isBeanExcludedFromAotProcessing} can be overridden.
