 * Interface used by the {@link DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader}
 * to handle custom, nested (directly under a {@code <bean>}) tags.
 *
 * <p>Decoration may also occur based on custom attributes applied to the
 * {@code <bean>} tag. Implementations are free to turn the metadata in the
 * custom tag into as many
 * {@link BeanDefinition BeanDefinitions} as
 * required and to transform the
 * {@link BeanDefinition} of the enclosing
 * {@code <bean>} tag, potentially even returning a completely different
 * {@link BeanDefinition} to replace the
 * original.
 *
 * <p>{@link BeanDefinitionDecorator BeanDefinitionDecorators} should be aware that
 * they may be part of a chain. In particular, a {@link BeanDefinitionDecorator} should
 * be aware that a previous {@link BeanDefinitionDecorator} may have replaced the
 * original {@link BeanDefinition} with a
 * {@link cn.taketoday.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean} definition allowing for
 * custom {@link org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor interceptors} to be added.
 *
 * <p>{@link BeanDefinitionDecorator BeanDefinitionDecorators} that wish to add an
 * interceptor to the enclosing bean should extend
 * {@link cn.taketoday.aop.config.AbstractInterceptorDrivenBeanDefinitionDecorator}
 * which handles the chaining ensuring that only one proxy is created and that it
 * contains all interceptors from the chain.
 *
 * <p>The parser locates a {@link BeanDefinitionDecorator} from the
 * {@link NamespaceHandler} for the namespace in which the custom tag resides.
