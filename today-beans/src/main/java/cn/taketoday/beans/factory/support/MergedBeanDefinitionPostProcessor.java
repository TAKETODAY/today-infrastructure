/**
 * Post-processor callback interface for <i>merged</i> bean definitions at runtime.

 * definition) that the Framework {@code BeanFactory} uses to create a bean instance.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #postProcessMergedBeanDefinition} method may for example introspect
 * the bean definition in order to prepare some cached metadata before post-processing
 * actual instances of a bean. It is also allowed to modify the bean definition but
 * <i>only</i> for definition properties which are actually intended for concurrent
 * modification. Essentially, this only applies to operations defined on the
 * {@link RootBeanDefinition} itself but not to the properties of its base classes.
