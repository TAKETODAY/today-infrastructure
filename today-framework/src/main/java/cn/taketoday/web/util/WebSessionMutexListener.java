/**
 * Servlet HttpSessionListener that automatically exposes the session mutex
 * when an HttpSession gets created. To be registered as a listener in
 * {@code web.xml}.
 *
 * <p>The session mutex is guaranteed to be the same object during
 * the entire lifetime of the session, available under the key defined
 * by the {@code SESSION_MUTEX_ATTRIBUTE} constant. It serves as a
 * safe reference to synchronize on for locking on the current session.
 *
 * <p>In many cases, the HttpSession reference itself is a safe mutex
 * as well, since it will always be the same object reference for the
 * same active logical session. However, this is not guaranteed across
 * different servlet containers; the only 100% safe way is a session mutex.
