/**
 * Annotation that identifies methods which initialize the

 * will be used for populating command and form object arguments
 * of annotated handler methods.
 *
 * <p>Such init-binder methods support all arguments that {@link RequestMapping}
 * supports, except for command/form objects and corresponding validation result
 * objects. Init-binder methods must not have a return value; they are usually
 * declared as {@code void}.
 *
 * <p>Typical arguments are {@link cn.taketoday.web.bind.WebDataBinder}
 * in combination with {@link RequestContext}
 * or {@link java.util.Locale}, allowing to register context-specific editors.
