/**
 * Annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value
 * to a named model attribute, exposed to a web view. Supported
 * for controller classes with {@link RequestMapping @RequestMapping}
 * methods.
 *
 * <p>Can be used to expose command objects to a web view, using
 * specific attribute names, through annotating corresponding
 * parameters of an {@link RequestMapping @RequestMapping} method.
 *
 * <p>Can also be used to expose reference data to a web view
 * through annotating accessor methods in a controller class with
 * {@link RequestMapping @RequestMapping} methods. Such accessor
 * methods are allowed to have any arguments that
 * {@link RequestMapping @RequestMapping} methods support, returning
 * the model attribute value to expose.
 *
 * <p>Note however that reference data and all other model content is
 * not available to web views when request processing results in an
 * {@code Exception} since the exception could be raised at any time
 * making the content of the model unreliable. For this reason
 * {@link ExceptionHandler @ExceptionHandler} methods do not provide
 * access to a {@link Model} argument.
