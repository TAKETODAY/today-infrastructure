/**
 * Marker for AOP proxy interfaces (in particular: introduction interfaces)
 * that explicitly intend to return the raw target object (which would normally
 * get replaced with the proxy object when returned from a method invocation).
 *
 * <p>Note that this is a marker interface in the style of {@link java.io.Serializable},
 * semantically applying to a declared interface rather than to the full class
 * of a concrete object. In other words, this marker applies to a particular
 * interface only (typically an introduction interface that does not serve
 * as the primary interface of an AOP proxy), and hence does not affect
 * other interfaces that a concrete AOP proxy may implement.
