/**
 * Indicates that a component is eligible for registration when one or more
 * {@linkplain #value specified profiles} are active.
 *
 * <p>A <em>profile</em> is a named logical grouping that may be activated
 * programmatically via {@link ConfigurableEnvironment#setActiveProfiles} or declaratively
 * by setting the {@link AbstractEnvironment#KEY_ACTIVE_PROFILES
 * context.profiles.active} property as a JVM system property, as an
 * environment variable, or as a Servlet context parameter in {@code web.xml}
 * for web applications. Profiles may also be activated declaratively in
 * integration tests via the {@code @ActiveProfiles} annotation.
 *
 * <p>The {@code @Profile} annotation may be used in any of the following ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>as a type-level annotation on any class directly or indirectly annotated with
 * {@code @Component}, including {@link Configuration @Configuration} classes</li>
 * <li>as a meta-annotation, for the purpose of composing custom stereotype annotations</li>
 * <li>as a method-level annotation on any {@link cn.taketoday.lang.Component @Component} method</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If a {@code @Configuration} class is marked with {@code @Profile}, all of the
 * {@code @Component} methods and {@link Import @Import} annotations associated with that class
 * will be bypassed unless one or more of the specified profiles are active. A profile
 * string may contain a simple profile name (for example {@code "p1"}) or a profile
 * expression. A profile expression allows for more complicated profile logic to be
 * expressed, for example {@code "p1 & p2"}. See {@link Profiles#of(String...)} for more
 * details about supported formats.
 *
 * <p>This is analogous to the behavior in XML: if the {@code profile} attribute of
 * the {@code beans} element is supplied e.g., {@code <beans profile="p1,p2">}, the
 * {@code beans} element will not be parsed unless at least profile 'p1' or 'p2' has been
 * activated. Likewise, if a {@code @Component} or {@code @Configuration} class is marked
 * with {@code @Profile({"p1", "p2"})}, that class will not be registered or processed unless
 * at least profile 'p1' or 'p2' has been activated.
 *
 * <p>If a given profile is prefixed with the NOT operator ({@code !}), the annotated
 * component will be registered if the profile is <em>not</em> active &mdash; for example,
 * given {@code @Profile({"p1", "!p2"})}, registration will occur if profile 'p1' is active
 * or if profile 'p2' is <em>not</em> active.
 *
 * <p>If the {@code @Profile} annotation is omitted, registration will occur regardless
 * of which (if any) profiles are active.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With {@code @Profile} on {@code @Component} methods, a special scenario may
 * apply: In the case of overloaded {@code @Component} methods of the same Java method name
 * (analogous to constructor overloading), an {@code @Profile} condition needs to be
 * consistently declared on all overloaded methods. If the conditions are inconsistent,
 * only the condition on the first declaration among the overloaded methods will matter.
 * {@code @Profile} can therefore not be used to select an overloaded method with a
 * particular argument signature over another; resolution between all factory methods
 * for the same bean follows constructor resolution algorithm at creation time.
 * <b>Use distinct Java method names pointing to the same {@link Component#value()}  bean name}
 * if you'd like to define alternative beans with different profile conditions</b>;
 * see {@code ProfileDatabaseConfig} in {@link Configuration @Configuration}'s javadoc.
