/**
 * When used as a type-level annotation in conjunction with

 * {@code @Scope} indicates the name of a scope to use for instances of
 * the annotated type.
 *
 * <p>When used as a method-level annotation in conjunction with
 * {@link Bean @Bean}, {@code @Scope} indicates the name of a scope to use
 * for the instance returned from the method.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> {@code @Scope} annotations are only introspected on the
 * concrete bean class (for annotated components) or the factory method
 * (for {@code @Bean} methods). In contrast to XML bean definitions,
 * there is no notion of bean definition inheritance, and inheritance
 * hierarchies at the class level are irrelevant for metadata purposes.
 *
 * <p>In this context, <em>scope</em> means the lifecycle of an instance,
 * such as {@code singleton}, {@code prototype}, and so forth. Scopes
 * provided out of the box in Framework may be referred to using the
 * {@code SCOPE_*} constants available in the {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory}
 * and {@code WebApplicationContext} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>To register additional custom scopes, see
 * {@link CustomScopeConfigurer CustomScopeConfigurer}.
