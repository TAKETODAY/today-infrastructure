/**
 * Indicates that a bean should be given preference when multiple candidates
 * are qualified to autowire a single-valued dependency. If exactly one
 * 'primary' bean exists among the candidates, it will be the autowired value.
 *
 * <p>This annotation is semantically equivalent to the {@code <bean>} element's
 * {@code primary} attribute in Spring XML.
 *
 * <p>May be used on any class directly or indirectly annotated with
 * {@code @Component} or on methods annotated with @{@link Bean}.
 *
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * <pre class="code">
 * &#064;Component
 * public class FooService {
 *
 *     private FooRepository fooRepository;
 *
 *     &#064;Autowired
 *     public FooService(FooRepository fooRepository) {
 *         this.fooRepository = fooRepository;
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * &#064;Component
 * public class JdbcFooRepository extends FooRepository {
 *
 *     public JdbcFooRepository(DataSource dataSource) {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * &#064;Primary
 * &#064;Component
 * public class HibernateFooRepository extends FooRepository {
 *
 *     public HibernateFooRepository(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Because {@code HibernateFooRepository} is marked with {@code @Primary},
 * it will be injected preferentially over the jdbc-based variant assuming both
 * are present as beans within the same Spring application context, which is
 * often the case when component-scanning is applied liberally.
 *
 * <p>Note that using {@code @Primary} at the class level has no effect unless
 * component-scanning is being used. If a {@code @Primary}-annotated class is
 * declared via XML, {@code @Primary} annotation metadata is ignored, and
 * {@code <bean primary="true|false"/>} is respected instead.
