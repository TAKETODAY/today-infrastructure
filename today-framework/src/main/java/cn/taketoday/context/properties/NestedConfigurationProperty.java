/**
 * Indicates that a field in a {@link ConfigurationProperties @ConfigurationProperties}
 * object should be treated as if it were a nested type. This annotation has no bearing on
 * the actual binding processes, but it is used by the
 * {@code spring-boot-configuration-processor} as a hint that a field is not bound as a
 * single value. When this is specified, a nested group is created for the field and its
 * type is harvested.
 * <p>
 * This has no effect on collections and maps as these types are automatically identified.
