/**
 * Sub-interface of {@link BeanPostProcessor} that adds a before-instantiation callback,

 * for example to create proxies with special TargetSources (pooling targets,
 * lazily initializing targets, etc), or to implement additional injection strategies
 * such as field injection.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> This interface is a special purpose interface, mainly for
 * internal use within the framework. It is recommended to implement the plain
 * {@link BeanPostProcessor} interface as far as possible.
