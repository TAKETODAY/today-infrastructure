/**
 * {@link FactoryBean} which returns a value which is the result of a static or instance
 * method invocation. For most use cases it is better to just use the container's
 * built-in factory method support for the same purpose, since that is smarter at
 * converting arguments. This factory bean is still useful though when you need to
 * call a method which doesn't return any value (for example, a static class method
 * to force some sort of initialization to happen). This use case is not supported
 * by factory methods, since a return value is needed to obtain the bean instance.
 *
 * <p>Note that as it is expected to be used mostly for accessing factory methods,
 * this factory by default operates in a <b>singleton</b> fashion. The first request
 * to {@link #getObject} by the owning bean factory will cause a method invocation,
 * whose return value will be cached for subsequent requests. An internal
 * {@link #setSingleton singleton} property may be set to "false", to cause this
 * factory to invoke the target method each time it is asked for an object.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE: If your target method does not produce a result to expose, consider
 * {@link MethodInvokingBean} instead, which avoids the type determination and
 * lifecycle limitations that this {@link MethodInvokingFactoryBean} comes with.</b>
 *
 * <p>This invoker supports any kind of target method. A static method may be specified
 * by setting the {@link #setTargetMethod targetMethod} property to a String representing
 * the static method name, with {@link #setTargetClass targetClass} specifying the Class
 * that the static method is defined on. Alternatively, a target instance method may be
 * specified, by setting the {@link #setTargetObject targetObject} property as the target
 * object, and the {@link #setTargetMethod targetMethod} property as the name of the
 * method to call on that target object. Arguments for the method invocation may be
 * specified by setting the {@link #setArguments arguments} property.
 *
 * <p>This class depends on {@link #afterPropertiesSet()} being called once
 * all properties have been set, as per the InitializingBean contract.
 *
 * <p>An example (in an XML based bean factory definition) of a bean definition
 * which uses this class to call a static factory method:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &lt;bean id="myObject" class="cn.taketoday.beans.factory.config.MethodInvokingFactoryBean"&gt;
 *   &lt;property name="staticMethod" value="com.whatever.MyClassFactory.getInstance"/&gt;
 * &lt;/bean&gt;</pre>
 *
 * <p>An example of calling a static method then an instance method to get at a
 * Java system property. Somewhat verbose, but it works.
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &lt;bean id="sysProps" class="cn.taketoday.beans.factory.config.MethodInvokingFactoryBean"&gt;
 *   &lt;property name="targetClass" value="java.lang.System"/&gt;
 *   &lt;property name="targetMethod" value="getProperties"/&gt;
 * &lt;/bean&gt;
 *
 * &lt;bean id="javaVersion" class="cn.taketoday.beans.factory.config.MethodInvokingFactoryBean"&gt;
 *   &lt;property name="targetObject" ref="sysProps"/&gt;
 *   &lt;property name="targetMethod" value="getProperty"/&gt;
 *   &lt;property name="arguments" value="java.version"/&gt;
 * &lt;/bean&gt;</pre>
