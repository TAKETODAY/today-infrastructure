/**
 * Interface for retrieving keys, typically used for auto-generated keys
 * as potentially returned by JDBC insert statements.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface can hold any number of keys.
 * In the general case, the keys are returned as a List containing one Map
 * for each row of keys.
 *
 * <p>Most applications only use one key per row and process only one row at a
 * time in an insert statement. In these cases, just call {@link #getKey() getKey}
 * or {@link #getKeyAs(Class) getKeyAs} to retrieve the key. The value returned
 * by {@code getKey} is a {@link Number}, which is the usual type for auto-generated
 * keys. For any other auto-generated key type, use {@code getKeyAs} instead.
