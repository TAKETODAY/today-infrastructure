/**
 * Allows for customization of the application's {@link Environment} prior to the

 * <p>
 * EnvironmentPostProcessor implementations have to be registered in
 * {@code META-INF/spring.factories}, using the fully qualified name of this class as the
 * key. Implementations may implement the {@link cn.taketoday.core.Ordered Ordered}
 * interface or use an {@link cn.taketoday.core.annotation.Order @Order} annotation
 * if they wish to be invoked in specific order.
 * <p> {@code EnvironmentPostProcessor} implementations may optionally
 * take the following constructor parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link DeferredLogFactory} - A factory that can be used to create loggers with
 * output deferred until the application has been fully prepared (allowing the environment
 * itself to configure logging levels).</li>
 * <li>{@link Log} - A log with output deferred until the application has been fully
 * prepared (allowing the environment itself to configure logging levels).</li>
 * <li>{@link ConfigurableBootstrapContext} - A bootstrap context that can be used to
 * store objects that may be expensive to create, or need to be shared
 * ({@link BootstrapContext} or {@link BootstrapRegistry} may also be used).</li>
 * </ul>
