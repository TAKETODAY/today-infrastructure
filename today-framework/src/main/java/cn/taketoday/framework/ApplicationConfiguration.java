   * Specify whether {@link Bean @Bean} methods should get proxied in order to enforce

   * method interception, implemented through a runtime-generated CGLIB subclass which
   * comes with limitations such as the configuration class and its methods not being
   * allowed to declare {@code final}.
   * <p>
   * The default is {@code true}, allowing for 'inter-bean references' within the
   * configuration class as well as for external calls to this configuration's
   * {@code @Bean} methods, e.g. from another configuration class. If this is not needed
   * since each of this particular configuration's {@code @Bean} methods is
   * self-contained and designed as a plain factory method for container use, switch
   * this flag to {@code false} in order to avoid CGLIB subclass processing.
   * <p>
   * Turning off bean method interception effectively processes {@code @Bean} methods
   * individually like when declared on non-{@code @Configuration} classes, a.k.a.
   * "@Bean Lite Mode" (see {@link Bean @Bean's javadoc}). It is therefore behaviorally
   * equivalent to removing the {@code @Configuration} stereotype.
