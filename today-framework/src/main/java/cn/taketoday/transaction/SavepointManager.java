 * Interface that specifies an API to programmatically manage transaction

 * <p>Note that savepoints can only work within an active transaction.
 * Just use this programmatic savepoint handling for advanced needs;
 * else, a subtransaction with PROPAGATION_NESTED is preferable.
 *
 * <p>This interface is inspired by JDBC 3.0's Savepoint mechanism
 * but is independent from any specific persistence technology.
