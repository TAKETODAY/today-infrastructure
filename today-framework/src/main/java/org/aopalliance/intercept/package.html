<p>This package provides a set of interfaces for interception
  mechanisms.</p>

<p>Interception is a basic mechanism to implement AOP. This is
  widely used in middlewares and modern application servers,
  including J2EE ones.

<p>This package provides an {@link
  org.aopalliance.intercept.Interceptor} interface that will
  intercept different runtime joinpoints (e.g. method calls, field
  access, ...). Thus, interceptors are able to add some behavior
  around the joinpoints actual executions. Several interceptors can
  be applied on a given joinpoint since they are chained. The AO
  system implementor should provide means to install and order these
  chains of interceptors.
