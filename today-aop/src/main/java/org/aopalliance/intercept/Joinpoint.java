 * runtime joinpoint on a method (static joinpoint). The static part of a given
 * joinpoint can be generically retrieved using the {@link #getStaticPart()}

 * reification of an access to an accessible object (a method, a constructor, a
 * field), i.e. the static part of the joinpoint. It is passed to the
 * interceptors that are installed on the static joinpoint.
