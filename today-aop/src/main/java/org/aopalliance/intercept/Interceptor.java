/**
 * This interface represents a generic interceptor.
 *
 * <p>
 * A generic interceptor can intercept runtime events that occur within a base
 * program. Those events are materialized by (reified in) joinpoints. Runtime
 * joinpoints can be invocations, field access, exceptions...
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface is not used directly. Use the the sub-interfaces to intercept
 * specific events. For instance, the following class implements some specific
 * interceptors in order to implement a debugger:
 *
 * <pre class=code>
 * class DebuggingInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor,
 *     ConstructorInterceptor, FieldInterceptor {
 *
 *   Object invoke(MethodInvocation i) throws Throwable {
 *     debug(i.getMethod(), i.getThis(), i.getArgs());
 *     return i.proceed();
 *   }
 *
 *   Object construct(ConstructorInvocation i) throws Throwable {
 *     debug(i.getConstructor(), i.getThis(), i.getArgs());
 *     return i.proceed();
 *   }
 *
 *   Object get(FieldAccess fa) throws Throwable {
 *     debug(fa.getField(), fa.getThis(), null);
 *     return fa.proceed();
 *   }
 *
 *   Object set(FieldAccess fa) throws Throwable {
 *     debug(fa.getField(), fa.getThis(), fa.getValueToSet());
 *     return fa.proceed();
 *   }
 *
 *   void debug(AccessibleObject ao, Object this, Object value) {
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
