description = """This project provides an abstraction around retrying failed operations, with an\
emphasis on declarative control of the process and policy-based behaviour that is\
easy to extend and customize. For instance, you can configure a plain POJO\
operation to retry if it fails, based on the type of exception, and with a fixed\
or exponential backoff.
