description = """
This project provides an abstraction around retrying failed operations, with an \
emphasis on declarative control of the process and policy-based behaviour that is \
easy to extend and customize. For instance, you can configure a plain POJO \
operation to retry if it fails, based on the type of exception, and with a fixed \
or exponential backoff.
