/**
 * A {@link RetrySimulator} is a tool for exercising retry + backoff operations.
 *
 * When calibrating a set of retry + backoff pairs, it is useful to know the behaviour of
 * the retry for various scenarios.
 *
 * Things you may want to know: - Does a 'maxInterval' of 5000 ms in my backoff even
 * matter? (This is often the case when retry counts are low -- so why set the max
 * interval at something that cannot be achieved?) - What are the typical sleep durations
 * for threads in a retry - What was the longest sleep duration for any retry sequence
 *
 * The simulator provides this information by executing a retry + backoff pair until
 * failure (that is all retries are exhausted). The information about each retry is
 * provided as part of the {@link RetrySimulation}.
 *
 * Note that the impetus for this class was to expose the timings which are possible with
 * {@link ExponentialRandomBackOffPolicy}, which
 * provides random values and must be looked at over a series of trials.
