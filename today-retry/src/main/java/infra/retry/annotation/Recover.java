/**
 * Annotation for a method invocation that is a recovery handler. A suitable recovery
 * handler has a first parameter of type Throwable (or a subtype of Throwable) and a
 * return value of the same type as the <code>@Retryable</code> method to recover from.
 * The Throwable first argument is optional (but a method without it will only be called
 * if no others match). Subsequent arguments are populated from the argument list of the
 * failed method in order.
