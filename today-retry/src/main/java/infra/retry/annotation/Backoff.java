 * <li>With no explicit settings the default is a fixed delay of 1000ms</li>
 * <li>Only the {@link #delay()} set: the backoff is a fixed delay with that value</li>
 * <li>When {@link #delay()} and {@link #maxDelay()} are set the backoff is uniformly

 * <li>With {@link #delay()}, {@link #maxDelay()} and {@link #multiplier()} the backoff is
