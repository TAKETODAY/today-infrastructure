/**
 * <p>
 * A disk-based implementation of the
 * {@link infra.mock.api.fileupload.FileItem FileItem}
 * interface. This implementation retains smaller items in memory, while
 * writing larger ones to disk. The threshold between these two is
 * configurable, as is the location of files that are written to disk.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In typical usage, an instance of
 * {@link infra.mock.api.fileupload.disk.DiskFileItemFactory DiskFileItemFactory}
 * would be created, configured, and then passed to a
 * {@link infra.mock.api.fileupload.FileUpload FileUpload}
 * implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following code fragment demonstrates this usage.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *        DiskFileItemFactory factory = new DiskFileItemFactory();
 *        // maximum size that will be stored in memory
 *        factory.setSizeThreshold(4096);
 *        // the location for saving data that is larger than getSizeThreshold()
 *        factory.setRepository(new File("/tmp"));
 *
 *        ServletFileUpload upload = new ServletFileUpload(factory);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Please see the FileUpload
 * <a href="https://commons.apache.org/fileupload/using.html" target="_top">User Guide</a>
 * for further details and examples of how to use this package.
 * </p>
