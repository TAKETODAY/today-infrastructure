/**
 * {@link Conditional @Conditional} that only matches when a bean of the specified class
 * is already contained in the {@link BeanFactory} and a single candidate can be
 * determined.
 * <p>
 * The condition will also match if multiple matching bean instances are already contained
 * in the {@link BeanFactory} but a primary candidate has been defined; essentially, the
 * condition match if auto-wiring a bean with the defined type will succeed.
 * <p>
 * The condition can only match the bean definitions that have been processed by the
 * application context so far and, as such, it is strongly recommended to use this
 * condition on auto-configuration classes only. If a candidate bean may be created by
 * another auto-configuration, make sure that the one using this condition runs after.
