/**
 * Annotation that marks a method as a listener for application events.
 *
 * <p>If an annotated method supports a single event type, the method may
 * declare a single parameter that reflects the event type to listen to.
 * If an annotated method supports multiple event types, this annotation
 * may refer to one or more supported event types using the {@code value}
 * attribute.
 *
 * <p>Events can be {@link ApplicationEvent} instances as well as arbitrary
 * objects.
 *
 * <p>Annotated methods may have a non-{@code void} return type. When they
 * do, the result of the method invocation is sent as a new event. If the
 * return type is either an array or a collection, each element is sent
 * as a new individual event.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
 * <p>While it is possible for an event listener to declare that it
 * throws arbitrary exception types, any checked exceptions thrown
 * from an event listener will be wrapped in an
 * {@link java.lang.reflect.UndeclaredThrowableException UndeclaredThrowableException}
 * since the event publisher can only handle runtime exceptions.
 *
 * <h3>Asynchronous Listeners</h3>
 * <p>If you want a particular listener to process events asynchronously, you
 * can use Async support, but be aware of the following limitations when using asynchronous events.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>If an asynchronous event listener throws an exception, it is not propagated
 * to the caller. See {@link AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler
 * AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler} for more details.</li>
 * <li>Asynchronous event listener methods cannot publish a subsequent event by returning a
 * value. If you need to publish another event as the result of the processing, inject an
 * {@link ApplicationEventPublisher ApplicationEventPublisher}
 * to publish the event manually.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Ordering Listeners</h3>
 * <p>It is also possible to define the order in which listeners for a
 * certain event are to be invoked. To do so, add common
 * {@link Order @Order} annotation
 * alongside this event listener annotation.
