 * Annotation for externalized configuration. Add this to a class definition or a
 * {@code @Bean} method in a {@code @Configuration} class if you want to bind and validate
 * some external Properties (e.g. from a .properties file).

 * Binding is either performed by calling setters on the annotated class or, if
 * {@link ConstructorBinding @ConstructorBinding} is in use, by binding to the constructor
 * parameters.
 * <p>
 * Note that contrary to {@code @Value}, EL expressions are not evaluated since property
 * values are externalized.
