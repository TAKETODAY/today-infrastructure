/**
 * Convenient superclass for JNDI-based service locators,
 * providing configurable lookup of a specific JNDI resource.
 *
 * <p>Exposes a {@link #setJndiName "jndiName"} property. This may or may not
 * include the "java:comp/env/" prefix expected by Jakarta EE applications when
 * accessing a locally mapped (Environmental Naming Context) resource. If it
 * doesn't, the "java:comp/env/" prefix will be prepended if the "resourceRef"
 * property is true (the default is <strong>false</strong>) and no other scheme
 * (e.g. "java:") is given.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses may invoke the {@link #lookup()} method whenever it is appropriate.
 * Some classes might do this on initialization, while others might do it
 * on demand. The latter strategy is more flexible in that it allows for
 * initialization of the locator before the JNDI object is available.
