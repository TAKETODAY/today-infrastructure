/**
 * A simple thread-backed {@link Scope} implementation.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> This thread scope is not registered by default in common contexts.
 * Instead, you need to explicitly assign it to a scope key in your setup, either through
 * {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory#registerScope}
 * or through a {@link CustomScopeConfigurer} bean.
 *
 * <p>{@code SimpleThreadScope} <em>does not clean up any objects</em> associated with it.
 * It is therefore typically preferable to use a request-bound scope implementation such
 * as {@code infra.web.context.request.RequestScope} in web environments,
 * implementing the full lifecycle for scoped attributes (including reliable destruction).
 *
 * <p>For an implementation of a thread-based {@code Scope} with support for destruction
 * callbacks, refer to
 * <a href="https://www.springbyexample.org/examples/custom-thread-scope-module.html">Spring by Example</a>.
 *
 * <p>Thanks to Eugene Kuleshov for submitting the original prototype for a thread scope!
