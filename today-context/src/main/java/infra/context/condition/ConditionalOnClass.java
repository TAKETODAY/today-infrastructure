/**
 * {@link Conditional @Conditional} that only matches when the specified classes are on
 * the classpath.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Class} {@link #value() value} can be safely specified on
 * {@code @Configuration} classes as the annotation metadata is parsed by using ASM before
 * the class is loaded. If a class reference cannot be used then a {@link #name() name}
 * {@code String} attribute can be used.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Extra care must be taken when using {@code @ConditionalOnClass} on
 * {@code @Bean} methods where typically the return type is the target of the condition.
 * Before the condition on the method applies, the JVM will have loaded the class and
 * potentially processed method references which will fail if the class is not present. To
 * handle this scenario, a separate {@code @Configuration} class should be used to isolate
 * the condition. For example:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @AutoConfiguration
 * public class MyAutoConfiguration {
 *
 *  @Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
 *  @ConditionalOnClass(SomeService.class)
 *  public static class SomeServiceConfiguration {
 *
 *    @Bean
 *    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
 *    public SomeService someService() {
 * 	    return new SomeService();
 *    }
 *
 *  }
 * }
 * }
